### Processes and System Calls


#### What is a process?

* An environment in which an application program runs
* A process includes virtualized resources that its program can use
    - one (or more) threads
    - virtual memory, used for the program's code and data
    - other resources
        + e.g. file and socket descriptors
* From now, programs have one thread
* A process itself is >1 thread
* Processes are created and managed by the kernel
* Each program's process isolates it from other programs in other processes
    - address space for every program is unique
    - programs/processes cannot talk to each other in direct manners


#### System Calls

* System calls are the interface between processes and the kernel
* A process uses system calls to request OS services
* Service examples
    - create, destroy, manage processes
        + `fork`, `execv`, `waitpid`, `getpid`
    - create, destroy, read, write files
    - ...


#### System Call Software Stack [L4_S4]

The application makes a call to the Syscall Library (API), which makes a system call to the kernel

* don't want user application to communicate with the kernel directly. The application and Syscall library are unprivileged code
* the kernel is privileged code
    - these are states we put the CPU in. The application is not permitted to communicate with the hardware, like shutting down the computer.
    - Why separate user code from the kernel?
        + Instead of using a nice abstracted library to access the kernel, then developers will try to interface with the hardware better than the kernel
        + So, different applications will have a bunch of different drivers. One of the goals of the kernel is to abstract itself/the hardware for user applications
        + Moreover, different hardware needs different drivers.
        + Additionally, errors like segmentation faults (which means you're writing to memory outside your address space) would not fire, and you'd end up overwriting memory you do not own.


#### Kernel Privilege

* The kernel runs at a higher level of execution privilege than application code
    - privilege levels are implemented by the CPU
* The kernel's higher privilege level allows it to do things that the CPU prevents less-privileged applications/programs from doing
    - e.g. application programs cannot modify the page tables that the kernel uses to implement process virtual memories
    - e.g. application programs cannot halt the CPU
    - Something needs to be able to manage these hardware-level settings, processes, data, etc.
* These restrictions allow the kernel to keep processes isolated from one anotherâ€”and from the kernel

Application programs cannot directly call kernel functions or access kernel data structures.


#### How System Calls Work (Part 1)

* Isolating Application/Syscall Library from Kernel
    - benefits
        + can patch the kernel without affection user applications
    - so how do we do things like save files, which requires privileges?

There are only two things that make kernel code run

* Interrupts
    - interrupts are generated by devices
    - an interrupt means a device (hardware) needs attention
* Exceptions
    - exceptions are caused by instruction execution
    - an exception means that a running program need attention
    - e.g. calling an assembly instruction that doesn't exist
    - e.g. dividing by 0
    - if we want to save a file, we will use exceptions


#### Interrupts Revisited

* An interrupt causes the ardware to transfer control to a fixed location in memory, where an interrupt handler is located.
    - the trap frame saves the complete context of the registers, and calls an interrupt handler from the kernel to figure out which interrupt was fired and how to deal with it
    - the trap frame must also switch the CPU from user-mode to kernel-mode (privileged-mode)
    - when restoring the context of the thread later, need to change from kernel-mode to user-mode
        + this is how the kernel gets its execution privilege


#### Exceptions

* Condition that occur during the execution of a program instruction
    - e.g. arithmetic overflows, illegal instructions, page faults
* Detected by the CPU during instruction execution
* CPU handles exceptions like it handles interrupts
    - control is transferred to a fixed location (trap frame), where an exception handler is located
    - processor is switched to privileged execution mode
* Exception handler is part of the kernel

##### MIPS Exception Types [L4_S9]

Note that OS/161 treats exceptions and interrupts the same way.

* EX_IRQ == 0 is a type of exception that represetns a hardware interrupt.
* When we want our application to make a kernel call, we fire a system call
    - we need to raise an exception of a "system type"
        + `EX_SYS`
            * indicates user application wants the kernel to do something

While inside trap frame, need to know what type of exception it was to figure out what to do

* One of the Exception Types will go into a register
* The trap frame will call the appropriate handler/dispatcher after reading the exception type


#### How System Calls Work (Part 2)

1. To perform a system call, the application program needs to raise an exception to make the kernel execute
    * on the MIPs, `EX_SYS` is the system call exception
2. To cause the exception on the MIPS, the application executes a special purpose instruction: `syscall`
    * other processor instruction sets include similar instructions
        - e.g. `syscall` on x86
3. Kernel's exception handler checks the exception code (set by the CPU when the exception is raised) to distinguish system call exceptions from other types of exceptions


#### System Call Software Stack (Updated) [L4_S11/S12]

1. Application makes call to Syscall wrapper library
2. Syscall Library raises an exception. The exception type is set in a register. The library function performs syscall instruction
3. The Kernel handles the exception, and returns the value(s) (in a register, perhaps)
    * creates trap frame to save application program state
    * determines that this is a syscall exception
    * determines which syscall is being requested
    * does the work for the requested system call
    * restores the application program state from the trap frame
    * returns from the exception
4. The Syscall Library function finishes and returns from its call
5. application continues excecution

```
li $v0, 1 ; load the system call code
; this code is predetermined
li $a0 ... $a3 ; load the system call params

syscall ; raises exception EX_SYS
```


#### Which System Call?

There are many different system calls, but only one syscall exception. How does the kernel know which system call the application is requesting?

* `kern/include/kern`
    - application binary interface (ABI)
    - `syscall.h`
        + contains type codes for different system calls
* the kernel defines a code for each system call it understands
* the kernel expects the application to place a code in a specified location before executing the syscall instruction
    - for OS/161 on MIPS, the code goes in register $v0
* the kernel's exception handler checks this code to determine which system call has been requested
* the codes and code location are part of the kernel ABI


#### Some OS/161 System Call Codes [L4_S14]


#### System Call Parameters

#### User and Kernel Stacks

* Every OS/161 process thread has two stacks, although it only uses one at a time
    - if it only had 1 stack?
        + suppose we're executing code, and reach an exception
        + there's no stack for the kernel code to execute
            * We don't want the kernel to expose its data to the user application by putting its data on the user application stack
* User Stack
    - used while application code is executing
    - this stack is located in the application's virtual memory
    - it holds activation records for application functions
    - the kernel creates this stack when it sets up the virtual address memory for the process
* Kernel Stack
    - used while the thread is executing kernel code, after an exception or interrupt
    - this stack is a kernel structure
    - in OS/161, the `t_stack` field of the thread structure points to this stack
    - this stack also holds activation records for kernel functions
    - this stack also holds trap frames and switch frames
        + kernel creates them, so it holds them
        + once the exception/interrupt is handled, trap frame restores thread context. It also reverts to the user stack. Then it reverts the CPU to user-privilege


#### Exception Handling in OS/161

* First to run is careful assembly code that...
    - saves the application stack pointer
    - switches the stack pointer to point to the thread's kernel stack
    - carefully saves application state and the address of the instruction that was interrupted in a trap frame on the thread's kernel stack


#### Implementing System Calls and Debugging

`kern/arch/mips/syscall.c`

* add syscall type handling here
* tf->tf_epc += 4
    - when receiving syscall, program counter will not advance. So, need to manually increment to jump over the syscall to avoid re-executing it

Debugging

* continue using -w flag
* set directory
* target the unix
* trace through the system call
    - put a breakpoint at the line where you call something like SYS_open
    - backtracing will show the stack contains only kernel function activations
