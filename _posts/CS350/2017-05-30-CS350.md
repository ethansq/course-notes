### Processes and System Calls


#### What is a process?

* An environment in which an application program runs
* A process includes virtualized resources that its program can use
    - one (or more) threads
    - virtual memory, used for the program's code and data
    - other resources
        + e.g. file and socket descriptors
* From now, programs have one thread
* A process itself is >1 thread
* Processes are created and managed by the kernel
* Each program's process isolates it from other programs in other processes
    - address space for every program is unique
    - programs/processes cannot talk to each other in direct manners
