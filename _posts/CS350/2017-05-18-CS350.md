#### SEMAPHORES

Consider a room. It has 73 seats (resources). Suppose students are threads. When they come in the room, they look for empty seats and sit down. If no available seat, then the thread must wait.

A semaphore helps keep track of which resources are available. Similar to a lock, but instead of a held/unheld, it keeps a counter of the # of resources available

* A semaphore is a synchronization primitive that can be used to enforce mutual exclusion requirements.
* Can be used to solve other kinds of synchronization problems
* A semaphore is an object that has an integer value, and that supports two operations
    - **P**: if the semaphore value > 0, decrement the value. Otherwise, wait until the value is greater than 0 and then decrement it
        + **take** a resource
        + "P the semaphore": __p__assering: passing
        + if the semaphore value is 0, block(?)
    - **V**: increment the value of the semaphore
        + **return** a resource
            + "V the semaphore": __v__rijigave: release
    - By definition, operations P and V are atomic
* Not necessarily about a critical section, but rather protecting a resource
    - Note, semaphores don't care who returns a resource
* **Binary semaphore**
    - initial_value = 1, only one resource available
    - effectively a lock
        + except someone else can V the semaphore (no ownership)
* **Counting semaphore**
    - initial_value >= 0
    - can start at 0, waiting for another thread to release resources

##### Producer/Consumer Synchronization with Bounded Buffer

* Suppose we have threads (producers) that add items to a buffer and threads (consumers) that remove items from the buffer
    - Subaru production plant in Indianapolis (producer). Creates cars and puts it in the parking lot (the buffer)
    - What if the parking lot (buffer) is full?
    - What if a consumer all the way from Vancouver comes to Indianapolis to pick up cars?
* Suppose we want to ensure that consumers do not consume if the buffer is empty. Instead they must wait **until the buffer has something in it**
    - If the parking lot is empty, don't send a truck from Vancouver to pick up items from the buffer
* Similarly, suppose the buffer has a finite capacity (*N*), and we need to ensure that producers must wait if the buffer is **full**
    - Subaru plant should not build more cars if their parking lot is already full

This requires synchronization between consumers and producers

* Semaphores can provide the necessary sync.
    - note, semaphores do not have a "get" function to check # of available resources
* Need 2 semaphores for 2 different **types of resources**
    - consumer's resources are "non-empty spots"
    - producer's resources are "empty spots"

```
struct semaphore *Items, *Spaces
Items = sem_create(...) // initially 0
Spaces = sem_create(...) // initially N

Producer's pseudo-code:
    P(Spaces)
    Add items to buffer
    V(Items)

Consumer's pseudo-code:
    P(Items)
    Remove items to buffer
    V(Items)
```

__Problem__

* Buffer is a global shared variable
    - Semaphore does not offer mutual exclusion when used in the way above. Above, it just keeps track of the items available
    - Can have multiple producers adding to the buffer at the same time
        + Need to protect the "add items" in a critical section

**A barrier semaphore**

* Semaphore whose initial value is 0. P the semaphore however many times for # of threads forked, and each thread will V the semaphore when it's done
    - This forces the parent thread to wait until all threads are completed


#### CONDITION VARIABLES

Another synchronization primitive

* Each condition variable is intended to work together with a lock
    - use lock to access a critical section
    - but, inside the section, need to wait for a condition variable to be true
        + are we just going to spin until some variable, say, `x=5`? This costs CPU bandwidth
        + the thread that may set `x=5` will/might need to make the update using the same lock you're currently occupying
* Condition variables are only used from within the critical section that is protected by the lock
* Say we have a bottle of beer
    - if beer in mug, drink
    - if no beer, hand is still on the mug, but while you're holding onto the beer, the bartender can't fill it up
        + if no beer, take hand off cup (release lock) and let bartender take cup (acquire lock)
        + bartender fills it, releases lock, gives beer back, wakes you up, you acquire lock again
* Three operations are possible on a condition variable
    - If we're in a critical section, and we realize a variable is not the way we want it, we call `cv_wait`
        + it relinquishes your hold on the critical section, and thread goes to sleep
        + lock is released as well
        + Once the thread is unblocked, it reacquires the lock
    - Once a variable has been updated, call `cv_signal` to wake one thread waiting on this condition variable
    - `cv_broadcast` is similar, but unblocks all threads that are blocked on the condition variable

##### Using Condition Variables

Condition variables get t
heir name because they allow threads to wait for arbitrary conditions to become true inside of a critical section

* Normally, each condition variable corresponds to a particular condition that is of interest to an application
    - for example, in the bounded buffer producer/consumer problem. Two conditions are
        + count > 0 // there are items in the buffer
        + count < N // there is free space in the buffer
    - when a condition is not true, a thread can `wait` on the corresponding condition variable until it becomes true
    - when a thread detects that a condition is true, it uses `signal` or `broadcast` to notify any threads that may be waiting
* Note that signalling (or broadcasting) to a condition variable that has no waiters has no effect. Signals do not accumulate

```
int volatile count = 0
struct lock *mutex; // for mutual exclusion
struct cv *notfull, *notempty // condition variables

Produce(itemType item) {
    lock_acquire(mutex);
    while (count == N) {
        cv_wait(notfull, mutex); // wait until buffer is not full
    }
    add item to buffer // list_append()
    count++
    cv_signal(notempty, mutex)
    lock_release(mutex)
}
```

```
itemType Consume() {
    lock_acquire(mutex)
    while (count == 0) {
        cv_wait(notempty, mutex) // wait until buffer is not empty
    }
    remove item // list_remove_front()
    count--
    cv_signal(notfull, mutex) // signal other threads that need notfull=true
    lock_release(mutex)
    return(item)
}
```

##### Waiting on Condition Variables

* When a blocked thread is unblocked (by `signal` or `broadcast`), it reacquires the lock before returning from the `wait` call
* A thread is in the critical section when it calls `wait`, and it will be in the critical section when `wait` returns
    - However, in between the call and the return, when the caller is blocked, th caller is out of the critical section, and the other thread may enter
* In particular, the thread that calls `signal` (or `broadcast`) to wake up the waiting thread will itself be in the critical section when it signals.
    - the waiting thread will have to `wait` (at least) until the signaller releases the lock before it can unblock and return from the `wait` call

If you are a thread that is to make the condition true, you need a lock to protect your access to the shared variable

* at the point you call cv_signal, you want to guarentee the condition is still true. That some fucker hasn't changed it between then and now
* must be the owner of the lock to signal or broadcast

```
cv_wait(cv *cv, lock *lock)
    wchan_lock(cv->wc)
    // cv needs own wait channel. Need to keep track of threads waiting on this condition
    lock_release(lock) // release hold on critical section
    // someone else needs access to the critical section to make it true
    wchan_sleep(cv->wc)
    --> on a signal or broadcast, code resumes here
    lock_acquire(lock)
    // we're working with the critical section again, need to acquire lock
```

##### Monitors

Next most similar thing to condition variables

* MESA
    - The condition variables that we described in our notes
    - Inside `cv_signal`, check if\_owner\_of\_lock, wchan_wakeone(cv->wchan)
* HOARE
    - Inside `cv_signal`, instead of waking up the thread and let you release the lock, and then let another thread reacquire the lock...
    - Signal thread and then you block. The other thread starts running again
