##### Assignment 2A Hints

__System calls__

* `pid_t fork(void)`
    - create a copy of the current process. Return 0 for child process, and the PID of the child process for the parent
    - many of the marks for 2A
    - create new process that is an identical clone of the process
    - When the two processes keep running, they can fork into different directions depending on the returned value (whether they're a child or parent)
* `pid_t waitpid(pid_t pid, int *status, int options)`
    - Waits for the process specified by pid. Status stores an encoding of the exit status and the exit code
    - Returns the PID of the process on success, or `-1` on error (it can also `return 0` if the option `WNOHANG` is specified and process PID...)
* `pid_t getpid(void)`
    - returns the PID of the current process
    - does not need to be implemented right away
* ...

##### fork

1. A process is really just a data structure that holds some information about the program running/to be run
    - Use `proc_create_runprogram(...)` to create the process structure
        + set up the VFS (file system) and console
        + found in `kern/proc/proc.c`
    - Don't forget to check for errors
        + e.g. what happens if `proc_create_runprogram` returns NULL?
            * Not enough memory, other issues with memory, etc
            * At every stage, we must check for an error. If we receive an error, need to return an error code
                - These error codes can be found in `kern/include/errno.h`
2. Create a new process structure for child process
    - empty to start with
    - Child process *must be identical to the parent* process
    - `as_copy()` creates a new address space, and copies the pages from the old address space to the new one
3. Create and copy address space (and data) from parent to child
    - Address space is not associated with the new process yet
        + look at `curproc_setas` to figure out how to give a process an address space
            * don't need to manually malloc and copy over
            * found in `kern/proc/proc.c`
            * note, you're not setting the address space of the current process, but rather the child process. See the implementation to see how to do update the address space of a different process
            * again, when encountering any error, need to return an error code
    - related functions can be found in `include/addrspace.h`
4. Attach the newly created address space to the child process structure
    - set the pointers properly using the helper functions
5. Assign PID to child process and create the parent/child relationship
    - How we do this is up to us
    - PIDs should be unique (no two processes should have the same PID)
    - PIDs should be reuseable
        + When can we reuse a PID?
        + This is partially dependent on your implementation. We'll talk more about this whn we look at `_exit` and `waitpid`
            * Also, in the future, need to create a parent-child relationship between two processes
                - maybe every parent keeps a list of its child processes (as pointers)
                - or a list of children PIDs which can be used as keys in a master table
        + **Remember that you need to provide mutual exclusion for any global structure!**
    - Need to look up a process in a process table later
        + Implementation of the table is up to us
6. Create thread for child process
    - need a safe way to pass the trapframe to the child thread
    - Now that we have a process, with an address space, with a PID, and a parent-child relationship, need to create a thread
    - `thread_fork(...)` has two params
        + the second takes a child process
        + entry point function? Take trap frame from parent and put it on the child thread kernel stack
            * pass it in some way from the parent into the child
            * if we look at the entry function prototype, it takes a void param. Can pass trapframe through there
            * if we pass pointer directly into the child, need to use synchronization
            * if we don't want to use synchronization, need to copy trapframe onto heap and pass the heap pointer to child
        + user stack is already prepared. We're setting up the kernel stack
            * When entry point for the new thread is running, will be in kernel mode
            * Copy data into a local variable and will be automatically in the kernel stack for the thread, because when the entry point starts running, it is running in kernel mode
        + using local trapframe variable, need to set register $a3 to be appropriate return values
        + also need to increment PC by 4
            * this is another local variable
        + **Do not modify the trapframe until we attach it to the child process**, so do it in the entry point function
7. Child thread needs to put the trapframe onto the stack and modify it so that it returns the current value (and executes the next instruction)
    - see above step
8. Call `mips_usermode` in the child's thread to go back to user-space
    - the child has no way on its own to go back to user-privilege
    - `mips_usermode` fakes a return from a `syscall`. Will return the trapframe and switch to user-mode

OS/161 provides a large number of helper functions

##### waitpid

Block parent process until child has exited by calling `_exit`

* Need to be implemented at the same time as `_exit`
* See `widefork.c` test for usage of `waitpid`
    - `WEXITSTATUS(...)` is implemented for us, only need to implement `waitpid`
* `waitpid` can only be called on a child
    - first things to check is if the given PID one of my children
        + if not, return immediately with an error code (see `errno.h`, or 2A hint)

1. If `waitpid` is called before the child process exits, then the parent must wait/block
    - What should it block on? Semaphore? Condition variable in a process table?
    - Condition variable specific to the parent process?
    - To the child process?
    - Use a condition variable. When `waidpid` is called, call `cv_wait` on the child process, thus blocking until the child exits
2. If `waitpid` is called after the child process has exited, then the parent should immediately get the exit status and exit code
    - the child needs to leave some data as long as its parent is alive
        + cannot lose this information. Need to be saved somewhere
        + suppose your parent is dead
            * do not keep code around. No one will care about your `rval` anymore
        + suppose a parent dies after all its children
            * can delete the exit codes left behind by its children
            * only time we keep these exit codes is when the parent still exists
3. PID cleanup should not rely on waitpid
    - parent process is not guaranteed to call `waitpid` when it exits
4. Encoding exit status and exit code
    - exit code comes from `_exit()`
    - In this assignment, exit status should always be `_WEXITED`
        + take the integer parameter from `exit()` and combine them
            * use a helper function to do this combination

In `_exit()`, when a child process dies, it should wake up its parent...

__Extras__

* Implement the `WNOHANG` option
    - if child is still alive, `return ECHILD` instead of blocking
    - this helps the parent ping the child, checking if it's still alive
* Add support for `WAIT_ANY (-1 PID)`
    - block until first child exits
    - return that child's PID in the return value

##### getpid

* Returns the PID of the current process
* (see slides from Piazza)

##### _exit

* Causes the current process to exit
    - don't worry about having multiple threads in a process
    - We don't expose `thread_fork` as a system call. Therefore, user processes will only have one thread
* Exit code is passed to the parent process
* When a child terminates if my parent is waiting on me to exit
    - if yes, need to wake
        + once they wake up, they will return from the `waitpid` call, get my exit status code, and delete me
    - only need to store the exit code if my parent is alive

##### Common Problems

* Whe implementing `fork`, there tends to be a struggle with putting the trapframe on the kernel stack
    - easy to do, but easy to make a mistake w/ memory (typical C-pointer problems)
* Deadlock on `waitpid` and `_exit`
* Deadlock on PID table



### Virtual Memory

Recall the form of the address space

`0x0`
`| code    | Data constants   | Heap ---\>    <--- Stack |`

__RAM__

OS is going to find some free space in RAM and give it to my program. Suppose our RAM looks like the following

`0x0`
`|           | Minecraft |     MATLAB     |              |`
                                                     `16gb`

* Suppose Minecraft used the address space from 0x10005000 to 0x10008000
* And MATLAB used 0x10008000 to 0xFFD00000
* If our user program knows exactly where it lives in real memory
    - this is an issue, because by virtue of knowing where I live in memory, I know where other people live in memory
    - I could access other people's memory using pointer arithmetic
    - It might be ok if Minecraft screws with MATLAB, but we'd have serious issues if Minecraft was touching our operating system's memory
