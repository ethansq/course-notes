* When we use virtual memory addresses, we need to ensure our translations between physical memory and virtual memory addresses to be efficient (and correct)
* Moreover, we need a kernel that is efficient at distributing physical memory
* A virtual address space can be smaller than the physical address space


#### Virtual Addresses

* The kernel provides a separate, private *virtual* memory for each process
* The virtual memory of a process holds the code, data, and stack for the program that is running in that process
* If virtual addresses are V bits, the maximum size of a virtual memory is `2^v` bytes
    - for MIPS, `V=32`
    - in our slides, `V=16`
* Running applications see only virtual addresses
    - program counter and stack pointer hold virtual addresses of the next instruction and stack
    - pointer to variables are virtual addresses
    - jumps/branches refer to virtual addresses
    - even our kernel will run on a virtual address space


#### Address Translation

* Each virtual memory is mapped to a different part of physical memory
    - if we want to execute an instruction, and we have its address, we need to find its actual address in physical memory
* Since virtual memory is not real, when a process tries to access (load or store) a virtual address, the virtual address is translated (mapped) to its corresponding physical address, and the load or store is performed in physical memory
* Address translation is performed in hardware, using information provided by the kernel
    - the Memory Management Unit (MMU) is a physical device, whose sole job is to take a virtual address and translate it into a physical address
    - the MMU cannot operate on its own
        + the OS needs to give some information. This info depends on the architecture and virtual memory implementation you have


#### Dynamic Relocation [vm_S7]

Suppose we have some physical memory

* 0x0 to 0x3ffff
* When we try to allocate memory for a new process, I will find a chunk of memory that fits the process, and I will claim it
    - I will also assign this chosen memory space for the process
    - perhaps PROCA will occupy 0x0 to 0x6fff
    - and PROB will occupy 0x6fff to ...
* If a process only needs 2KB, that's all we give it. We don't necessarily allocate the limit/maximum memory a process could use
* Static relocation
    - We allocate memory as we go, for however much the process requires
    - Problems
        + Suppose PROC_C occupied 2KB
        + and PROC_E occupied 10KB
        + We free the two, but the two processes had separate locations (non-adjacent) in memory
            * We freed 12KB, but it is fragmented. A 12KB program will not be able to fit, though we'd like it to be able to
* Dynamic Relocation
    - When we encounter fragmentation, we just shift some processes' physical address space
    - We keep track of the offset (from 0) and the limit of the process's memory usage
        + We use `offset` and `limit` to do our translation


#### Address Translation for Dynamic Relocation

* CPU includes the MMU, with a relocation register and a limit register
    - relocation register holds the physical offset (R) for the running process' virtual memory
    - limit register holds the size L (limit) of the running process' virtual memory

```
if v >= L, then generate exception
else
    p = v + R
```

* recall, the virtual address begins at 0 and is limited 
* The kernel maintains a separate `R` and `L` for each process, and changes the values in the MMU registers when there is a context switch between processes


#### Properties of Dynamic Relocation

* Each virtual address space corresonds to a contiguous range of physical addresses
    - OS is responsible for finding a contiguous walk of memory
    - If a process requires 2GB, we need 2GB of contiguous memory
        + What are the odds of finding 2GB of free memory?
        + Dynamic relocation lets us defragment our memory in order to find this contiguous walk of 2GB
            * Problem is that this defragmentation is rather slow
                - Have to move almost every other process' address space
* While dynamic relocation is the easiest, and maybe fasted, it is susceptible to internal fragmentation
    - Solving this is difficult
    - Although it is efficient in how much data is required to implement, and how fast the translation occurs

__Example: Process A [vm\_S10]__

```
Limit register:      0x0000 7000
Relocation register: 0x0002 4000

v = 0x102C  p = 0x0002 502C
v = 0x8800  p = exception
v = 0x0000  p = 0x0002 4000
```

__Example: Process B [vm\_S11]__

```
Limit register:      0x0000 c000
Relocation register: 0x0001 3000

v = 0x102C  p = 0x0001 402C
v = 0x8800  p = 0x0001 B800
v = 0x0000  p = 0x0001 3000
```

* Note, theoretically, virtual memory addresses could be the same as physical memory addresses
    - The offset will have to be 0
    - However, since the OS/kernel resides at address 0 in physical memory, this shouldn't happen


#### Problem with Dynamic Relocation

* As mentioned earlier, in order to find a contiguous range, we need to defragment some memory. Finding the memory to defragment is too much work

__Potential Solution__

* If we can't find a contiguous piece of memory, why can't we just find the different chunks of free memory and put them together?
    - This is tough to manage, but we do have a solution along these lines


#### Paging: Physical Memory

* Suppose we have 256KB total physical memory
* We pick some size, divide the entire physical memory in pieces of this size
    - Suppose we choose a physical page size of 4KB (4096 bytes)
    - We divide 256KB by 4KB, and so we have 64 frames/pages of memory

__Note__
    
- 4KB is `2^12`
- `2^12` is 4096 bytes
- 4096 is 0x1000

* If I have a 4KB frame, I should have 4KB pages
* Each address space, now, will also be divide into some number of pages
* We won't have external fragmentation here, but we will have some internal fragmentation
    - If you only need 1KB, you're going to get 4KB anyways
* Suppose we need 28KB for a process
    - We traverse our physical memory and find (and use) the first 7 (x4 = 28KB) unoccupied pages
    - We can have pages across memory, and it need not be in order
    - This solves the external fragmentation because we look for pages, which is the same size of the frame. So, we never allocate for anything bigger or smaller that we need(?)
* With this implementation, we've mapped pages of virtual memory to frames of physical memory
    - These frames don't have to be in RAM
    - Most OS's only load pages of the address space in RAM that you are actively using
        + Your address space can have some pages in memory, other pages in other devices
            * this is called Demand Paging


#### Page Tables

* Knowing page number, you can figure out the address of the frame
* This table is created and maintained by the operating system
* Every process has own page table
* Size of the page table?
    - `size = virtual memory size / page size`
        * not how much memory, but rather how many entries


#### Address Translation in the MMU, Using Paging

* The MMU includes a page table base register which points to the page table for the current process
* How the MMU translates a virtual address
    - determine the page number and offset of virtual address
        + page number is the virtual address divided by the page size
        + offset is the virtual address modulo the page size
    - looks up the page's entry (PTE) in the current process page table, using the page number
    - if the PTE is not valid, raise an exception
    - otherwise, combine the page's frame number from the PTE with the offset to determine the physical address
        + `physical address = (frame number * frame size) + offset`

__See vm\_S17 for illustration of Address Translation__

```
page # = v / page size

offset = v % page size
// modulo with hex??
// how many bits does my page # need?
// how many entries in our page table? If we have virtual memory that is
// 64KB, we have 16 pages (maximum)
// How many bits do I need to represent 16? 4 bits
// How many bits do I chop off for the modulo?

// how many bits for pg#? log(size(PTE));
// if PTE=16, then bits for pg#=4
// take virtual address and the highest order 4 bits are the pg#. The rest are the offset
// this is easier to apply to hex than actually modulo'ing hex

// assuming PTE lookup was valid
physical address = (frame # * frame size) + offset
```

* The OS for OS/161 determines the stack size for processes
    - Modern OS's have more flexibility but OS/161 just uses this simplification
