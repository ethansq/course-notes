#### Multiprocessing

Recall we have a quantum. When it expires, we have a pre-emption, and thus a context switch.

* The kernel just sees threads. If we have two (single-threaded) processes, we'll have timer interrupts
    - This interrupt will cause a switch to kernel mode
    - Will check how long the thread's been running
        + Not long enough? Go back to Process A
    - Keep checking until it exceeds the quantum
* The kernel looks at the ready pool of threads and chooses another thread to run
    - In this example, Process B starts running
    - When Process B exceeds the quantum, Process A starts running again


##### Animation Notes

* Process 1 is running its application. It maintains its application stack frames.
    - `close(1)`
        + executes like normal, adds a stack frame
    - Makes a syscall: `li a0,1 ; li v0,49 ; syscall`
        + Starts running common_exception function
            * switches from user mode to privileged mode, and switches to the thread's kernel stack
            * saves processor state (registers, etc) into a trap frame
            * Now, need to deal with the exception
        + mips_trap(...)
            * Check whether this is an exception, interrupt, or system call
        + syscall(...)
            * Checks the code of the interrupt
            * Turn off interrupts for a little bit. If the exception code is not an interrupt, we turn interrupts back on immediately
                - When a hardware device fires an interrupt, it will keep firing until the CPU acknowledges it has been handled
        + sys_close(...)
* While kernel is trying to execute `sys_close(...)`
    - Pre-emption continues even if we are executing kernel code
    - When transferring control to `mips_exception`, don't need to switch to privilege-mode, nor switch to kernel stack, because we've already done that
    - mips_trap()
    - ...
    - `thread_yield()`
    - `thread_switch()`
    - switch frame
* Process 2: suppose it had some stuff in its kernel stack already (it was executing before)
    - It executes the code (pops the stack), goes through the trap frame, etc
    - Switch from kernel-mode to user-mode

Suppose the interrupt never happened. We continue off from the first `sys_close(...)`

* Handle the sys_close(...)
    - increment PC by 4, etc
* Return from `syscall(...)`
* Return from `mips_trap(...)`
* We're back the trap frame
    - Need to jump back to thread's application code
    - `rfe` returns the CPU to unprivileged mode


#### System Calls for Process Management

* `fork` creates a new process
    - does not createa new blank process, but rather an identical clone to the process that called `fork`
        + user stack is the same
        + values in registers are the same
        + address spaces are the same
    - difference is that when `fork`ing, the new process does have a new id number
    - `fork` returns in both the parent and the child. Their program counter is pointing to the same instruction
    - also, return value of `fork` is different
        + parent returns process id of new process that was created as a result of calling `fork`
        + child returns 0
* `execv` changes the program that process runs
* `_exit` destroys a process. It is called manually
    - terminates the process that calls it
    - process may supply an exit status code when it exits
        + the kernel keeps this return value for future use
* `waitpid` synchronizes processes to run in a particular order
    - lets a process wait for another to terminate, and retrieve its exit status code (from `_exit`)
    - makes sense. Sometimes we want to wait for another process to terminate before proceeding
    - `waitpid` is equivalent to watching a child
        + when a child dies, the parent will want to know why it died
        + it will block the process until the child dies, and provides the exit status
* `getpid` for attribute management

##### Some Code: `fork`, `_exit`, `getpid`, and `waitpid`

```
main() {
    rc=fork(); // returns 0 to child, pid to parent
    if (rc==0) { // child executes this code
        my_pid = getpid();
        x = child_code();
        _exit(x);
    } else { // parent executes this code
        child_pid = rc; // if we're in the parent code, rc is the child\_pid
        parent_pid = getpid();
        parent_code();
        p = waitpid(child\_pid, &child\_exit, 0);
        if (WIFEXITED(child_exit))
            printf("child exit status was %d\n", WEXITSTATS(child_exit));
    }
}
```

All `fork` does is create a clone of the existing process

* If we want to open a program from a shell, we can't just fork the shell...
* In order to set what program the process should run, you need to use `execv`
    - When we call `execv`, we need to change the process' address space. Clear out the stack, etc
    - Open the binary file
    - Create a new address space and new block of memory that is appropriate for the new program
        + With a new program, it starts executing at the entry point
    - id of the process does not change
    - user of the process does not change

##### Some code: `execv`

```
int main() {
    int rc=0;
    char *args[4]; // array of strings

    args[0] = (char *) "/testbin/argtest";
    args[1] = (char *) "first";
    args[2] = (char *) "second";
    args[3] = 0;

    rc = execv("/testbin/argtest", args);

    // if execv succeeds, the program that called it is killed
    // it does not return
    // the last thing execv does is jr'ing to the beginning of the execution of the new program
    printf("If you see this, execv failed\n");
    printf("rc = %d errno = %d\n", rc, errno);
    exit(0);
}
```
