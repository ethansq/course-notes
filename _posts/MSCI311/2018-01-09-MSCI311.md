## MODULE 1


#### Different Approaches to Organizations

Organizations are difficult to define, but we can try

* 6 blind men
	* Our current understanding of organizations is based on a large amount of peoples' and consultants' experiences. However, every one of these individuals only had a partial view of the organization


### 1A Defining Organizations: Based on a Common Goal

* A collection of individuals deliberately structured to achieve a pre-determined goal(s)
* Some **aspects** of an organization are obvious, some need to be identified on our own
	* Structure & design (non ad-hoc)
	* Goal-oriented
		* There is an extent of planning that is required as well. The organization is self-aware of its goals
	* Personality
		* An organization is a social system, hence social science qualities apply
		* People have their own goals, personalities, and attributes.
	* Somewhat of a permanent structure
		* Has to exist for some time, and be well-defined
	* Use technology
		* Information systems, operation know-how, etc.
	* Interact with the environment and landscape
* Prescriptive: Tells us what organizations ought to be, rather than what they are

Ideally, we have people working towards a defined goal. However, there are issues with this

* Goals aren't always easy to define
	* Can be irrational: visions, ideas, concepts, growth
	* Goals get transformed as they go down the hierarchy.
		* People approach it with their own perspectives and opinions, and sometimes they don't align with the overall 
* What is the common goal of the University of Waterloo? Do faculties, staff, and administrators have one common goal?


#### Our definition

An **organization is a set of formal and informal constraints** that result in **patterns of behaviour**

* Formal and informal constraints --> Patterns of behaviour
	* eg. Employees must be at work between 2-4PM (formal)
	* eg. Dress codes are sometimes formal, but often informal
		* Can **indicates a culture**
	* Don't tell us what an organization should be, but rather simply, if you want to define an organization, you must look at its patterns of behaviour, and analyze its constraints
* **Constraints regulate patterns of behaviour**


### 1B Understanding Organizational Theories

* Organizations are 'man-made'
* They are not the result of natural evolution
* Core competency
	* Federal government told universities to show that their resources and efforts are in alignment with their ...

**Management fads**

* Agile, hackatons, innovation landscapes, reward systems like employee stocks, etc.
	* What makes them management fads? These _new ideas_ are methods of introducing growth and fresh concepts
	* They come and go


#### Research considerations

Unit of analysis

* Tells us what theories are focused on: **the fundamental element of interest**
* Important to find the most suitable unit of analysis 	depending on what the research question is
* What might be the unit of analysis in researching the following questions?
	* What is the effect of market uncertainty on organizationl productivity?
		* Profit year-over-year, ...
	* What roles do participants take in organizational decision making?
		* People(?), the decisions being made(?), ...
* If studying a particular company, then results _should_ be very applicable to that company, but it won't be very generalizable
	* The focal point matters
* **Prescriptive Approaches**
	* eg. Take a break for 10 minutes every 50 minutes of work
	* eg. Do the most difficult work when feeling the best
* **Descriptive Approaches**
	* ...


### 1C Scientific Management

* Taylor's Theory?
* Take people's work and **modularize it**
	- Come up with the most optimal way of doing each task, and give workers indepedent tasks
		+ Implications in modern manufacturing
	- How do workers react to this kind of management?
	- Very much internal: didn't care about governments, suppliers, etc.
		+ Only tasks conducted by this organization
* Problems with this approach
	* **Limited applicability**
		* Physical v. cognitive tasks
		* Individual v. group tasks
	* **Undersirable consequences of optimization**
		* Repetitive work
			* No control over what is being done and how it is done
			* Workers are replaceable
		* Loss of autonomy
* **Prescriptive**
	- Told people what to do, and didn't care to consider workers' opinions

### 1D Bureaucracy

* Idea: Operate a business rationally and with efficiency
	* Bureaucracies are the backbones of organizations
	* The idea was to make organizations **as rational as possible.**
		* As soon as someone left the job, all of the knowledge they had is lost
			* Don't want to re-invent the wheel...
* Why not make organizations predictable in its structure?
* **Activity**: Apply the following rules to a UW job description
	1. The role/office must have fixed and official jurisdictional areas ordered by rules
		* It's clear what the position has authority/responsibility over
		* It's clear what the position should be doing
		* Doesn't matter who is hired (strengths, weaknesses, perspectives), the position is written in stone/policy
	2. Positions/roles have a firmly ordered office hierarchy
		* ie. chain of command
		* Know exactly who the position reports to, and who reports to the position
			* Not up for discussion
		* The higher up the hierarchy, descriptions become more vague (high-level)
	3. The activities of the office should be based on written documents (the files)
		* There are rules, documents, and files that dictate the position and its qualities

**Example**

* Mathematics Faculty Computing Facility --> Manager, Client Support Services Inst
	1. External support activities, management of assigned technical projects, internal support activities, computer systems admin, ...
		* This position has X key jurisdictional areas that they are responsible for; and, it is clear
	2. Supervises data support, and reports to Associate Dean of Computing
	3. What kind of files would this position generate/work with?
		* Compile documentation of internal space used by clients
		* Provide input into strategic budgeting decisions based on this information
* If you cannot find specific documents, consider generic files
	* eg. co-op managers have to deal with performance evaluations, etc.


##### There is no "Organization" without bureacracy

* Issues don't arise because bureacracy is implemented. They arise because there's too much bureacracy
	* It's not suitable, rules are outdated, rules are too restrictive
	* Sometimes, there's not enough bureacracy
	* This is a very important aspect of organizations. Finding the right balance is important.


##### Issues with bureacracy

* Rules are not always appropriate
	* Clinics "force" you to wait for test results before prescribing medication
		* What if the results are clear without waiting for a lab?
		* eg. Can't we take shortcuts to get simple antibiotics against strep throat?
* Rules are hard to change
	* 
* Making decisions based on limited information
	* Every time information moves up on the hierarchy, information gets lost
	* Higher-ups don't always read entire reports written by lower-level employees


### 1E Human Relations

Existence of informal organization (social organization) with its own normals, values, and expectations

* Social organization has a great impact on productivity
* The Hawthorne studies have had a great influence on modern organizational science
	* Managing involves getting things done through people
	* As such, management should focus on employee attitudes, perspectives, and interpersonal relations
		* ie. individual behaviour


##### Issues

* Group decision making (to make everyone happy) is not always feasible
	* Too much input --> too difficult to coordinate
	* Mutually exclusive expectations, can't satisfy them all
* Cultural change is difficult
