### ART AND ARCHITECTURE


#### I. ART

##### A) Painting

- Wall & Panel Paintings
    * Greeks did a lot of this, but they didn't really survive over time
    * Painted on wood or wooden panels
        - Wood tends to rot, and very few wall and panel paintings survived

##### B) Vase Paintings

**Material**
        
* Pottery vessels many styles and sizes
* Pottery was curved, which necessitated skilled painters

**Development**

- This is much easier to trace than wall paintings, due to their better survival

__Geometric (900-700 BC)__

+ patterns were very rectilinear
+ lines are in parallel, and even human bodies were drawn with straight lines (like triangles) rather than curves
+ bichromatic
    * two colours: black and the lighter colour of the pottery itself
        - black was done using slip. This solution became black when the pot was fired

__Orientalizing (700-600 BC)__

+ art is now curvilinear
+ began portraying humans and (esp.) animals, both domestic and wild
+ as well as monstrous compositie animals
    * lions, snakes, roosters
    * some portrayals are mythical
+ polychromatic
+ style originated from Corinth
    * interesting, because Athens was the big location for Geometric pottery
    * the trend had switched to Corinth
    * In the latter part of 700 BC, Corinth became very prosperous due to trade
        - Corinthians made their city a center of trade
        - They were on the sea, had a large fleet of merchant ships, and were also right on the little gap between East and West Greece
            + Ships didn't want to go around the Polyponnesus, so they docked at Corinth, and the Corinthians dragged these ships across the Isthmus, allowing a shorter and also safer passage
        - This exposure allowed Corinth to stay "trendy"
+ tree of life theme
    * from the East, with mythical symbol

__Black-figure (700- BC)__

+ Artisans in Corinth developed a new technique called black-figure
    * which spread across Greece
+ painted silhouette and fill of a character with a slip, which turned black when the pot was fired
    * eg. Hericles and the Nemean Lion
+ after firing, the artisan would carve lines within the silhouette. These incisions act as the details/lighter colour
    * can do musculature, etc.
+ around this time, artists began to adapt to the curvature of the pottery in their art
 
__Red-figure (530- BC)__

+ Instead of painting the figure of the slip, and firing it like in black-figure, the artist paints the background with slip
+ Details and fine-lines are painted in slip as well, and then fired
+ Developed in Athens. Corinth had lost its dominance by this point
    - Athens dominated trade before Red-figure had been developed
+ Advantages
    * black-figure makes everything look blank (the background would be empty)
    * in red-figure, the background looks "full" because it has colour. It's a more striking way to present art, since the contrast works for it rather than against it
+ Since the Geometric era, the Greeks had been trying to make their figures more and more realistic
+ Note about realism in art
    * Plato felt realism in art was deceptive, because art is not physically real.

**Themes**

1. Orientalizing period
    * floral/vegetal and animal motifs predominated
2. 7th-6th century BC
    * Athenians began trend toward mythological themes
3. Late 6th century BC
    * contemporary scenes
        - athletics, symposia, school, pederastic courtship
    * problem of interpretation(?)
        - sometimes, there'd be multiple interpretations and people wouldn't know which one was "correct"
        - is this a problem with the mythological themes of 7th-6th century BC, or with contemporary late 6th century scenes?


#### II. ARCHITECTURE

##### A) Materials

Mud brick and wood until ca. 650 BC, then stone

* They learned stonework from the Egyptians
    - Egyptians, by this time, had had stone temples for millenia
    - cf. kouroi statues
        + before, Greeks made statues of gods/goddesses out of wood, mostly. Sometimes bronze
        + kouroi (sing. kouros) were statues of males, and looked very egyptian
            * very stiff
            * became more lifelike/realistic over the years
            * not idealized dimensions, but more realistic (and also more fluid, showing movement)

##### B) Style

1. Distinctively Greek, with columns and horizontal architraves with low-pitched roofs and pediments
    * between the temple itself and the columns, it's like porches of sheltered area
    * the columns lined the outside
    * the pediment is the flat triangular section at the end of the temple (above the columns, on the side; the end of the roof)
        - there'd be statues inside this pediment
    * roofs were low-pitched, and so the pediments were relatively flat
    * there's also some friezes
        - right below the pediment are triglyphs (little columns), that run across
        - the frieze is the running horizontal panel below the pediment that houses the triglyphs 
2. Orders (styles of Greek temples)
    * they all have columns, pediments, and friezes, etc
        - however, some variances can be found among the styles
    * __Doric__
        - oldest, originated in North-east Peloponnesus, simpler and heavier
        - column height were 6 times the lower diameter
            + looked heavier, and exudes a sense of sturdiness and power
        - had friezes of metopes and triglyphs
            + metopes were empty spaces that probably had relief sculptures in them, but not always
    * __Ionic__
        - originated from Ionia
        - column heights were 9 times the lower diameter of the column
            + seemed lighter
        - more ornate with continuous friezes
            + eg. Volutes
            + continuous friezes were not divided by triglyphs
        - eg. Temple of Artemis
            + very fancy and ornate. Had some spirals at the top, but we're not sure what they were supposed to be
    * __Corinthian__
        - more elaborate and fancier
        - not very important in classical times, so not going to talk about this much

##### C) Propaganda

1. Temple of Zeus at Olympia
    * very rich temple
    * monumental chryselephantine statue of Zeus
        - made of chryses (gold)
            + clothes would be pure/gilded gold
        - elephantines (elephant) denotes ivory
            + statue of Zeus was around 40ft tall. The skin of this figure of Zeus would be made of ivory
    * Olympia had the games every 4 years, a celebration of Zeus, who represented overall Greek society
        - the power of the Greeks, civilization, culture, etc
    * served the same function for all the Greeks the same way that the Parthenon (in Athens) served as propaganda for the Athenians
2. Parthenon
    * Was on the acropolis of Athens, and represented Athenian culture
    * funded by the money from the Athenian Empire
        - represented the impressiveness of Athens
    * glorified Athenian civilization sophistication and **power** in particular
    * Was rebuilt(?) after the Persian assault of 480 BC, allowing it to represent Athenia victory and power
    * East pediment: __portrayed birth of Athena__
        - Zeus didn't want to be usurped
            + a propecy stated he'd be usurped by his son
        - So he swallowed Metis (his first wife) to prevent her from giving birth to his supposed male usurper
        - However, Athena turned out to be female, and sprang from Zeus' head
            + One version: Zeus had a headache, and Hephaestus smacked his head with an axe
                * Athena jumps out in full armour
        - Athena is powerful because she sprang from Zeus' head fully armed, and is the embodiment of war and civilization/wisdom/sophistication
            + she was an apt goddess for Athens to choose as their patron goddess
    * West pediment: __portrayed the contest between Athena and Poseidon__
        - Athens was to choose their patron deity, and had to choose between Athena and Poseidon
        - Poseidon stabs the ground to great a spring
        - Athena plants an olive tree
            + Athenians liked this more, and chose Athena
    * Outside: Doric frieze. The Parthenon also had an Ionic frieze on the inside of the porch, on the walls of the temple itself
        - __Story of the Lapiths and the Centaurs__
            + Lapiths were a tribe of Greek
            + Centaurs: half human, half horse
            + Centaurs were invited to a wedding of the King of the Lapiths, a friend of Theseus
                * Centaurs couldn't hold their wine, and went crazy, and tried to steal the bride
                * Theseus (King of Athens) helps the King and the Greek Lapiths defeat the Centaurs
                    - The King of __Athens__ helps __defeat__ creatures of __anti-civilization__
        - __The Trojan War__
            + Greeks v. Eastern Trojans
                * Trojans represent the Persians, whom the Athenians had just defeated
                * Trojans represent anti-civilization forces
                * Athenians often assimilated barbarians into/as beasts
        - __Gigantomachy__
            + Greeks were one time threatened by the giants: mindlessly violent monsters
            + Greek gods managed to defeat these, again, anti-civilizing forces (of chaos and destruction of order)
            + Propaganda, again, is that the Greek gods are defeating uncivilization
        - __Amazonomachy__
            + War between the Amazons and the Athenians
            + When Thesus was King of Athens, he went to the land of the Amazons with Heracles and brought back the Queen of the Amazons
                - they banged(?)
            + The Amazons invaded Athens, but the Athenians managed to drive them back
            + Again, the Amazons were portrayed as a threat to civilization
    * There is also a chryselephantine statue of Athena (the Virgin)

__Subtext__

These temples and statues all portrayed themes of Greeks/Athenians defending against forces of un-civilization
