### ART AND ARCHITECTURE


#### I. ART

##### A) Painting

- Wall & Panel Paintings
    * Greeks did a lot of this, but they didn't really survive over time
    * Painted on wood or wooden panels
        - Wood tends to rot, and very few wall and panel paintings survived

##### B) Vase Paintings

**Material**
        
* Pottery vessels many styles and sizes
* Pottery was curved, which necessitated skilled painters

**Development**

- This is much easier to trace than wall paintings, due to their better survival
- __Geometric (900-700 BC)__
    + patterns were very rectilinear
    + lines are in parallel, and even human bodies were drawn with straight lines (like triangles) rather than curves
    + bichromatic
        * two colours: black and the lighter colour of the pottery itself
            - black was done using slip. This solution became black when the pot was fired
- __Orientalizing (700-600 BC)__
    + art is now curvilinear
    + began portraying humans and (esp.) animals, both domestic and wild
    + as well as monstrous compositie animals
        * lions, snakes, roosters
        * some portrayals are mythical
    + polychromatic
    + style originated from Corinth
        * interesting, because Athens was the big location for Geometric pottery
        * the trend had switched to Corinth
        * In the latter part of 700 BC, Corinth became very prosperous due to trade
            - Corinthians made their city a center of trade
            - They were on the sea, had a large fleet of merchant ships, and were also right on the little gap between East and West Greece
                + Ships didn't want to go around the Polyponnesus, so they docked at Corinth, and the Corinthians dragged these ships across the Isthmus, allowing a shorter and also safer passage
            - This exposure allowed Corinth to stay "trendy"
    + tree of life theme
        * from the East, with mythical symbol
- __Black-figure (700- BC)__
    + Artisans in Corinth developed a new technique called black-figure
        * which spread across Greece
    + painted silhouette and fill of a character with a slip, which turned black when the pot was fired
        * eg. Hericles and the Nemean Lion
    + after firing, the artisan would carve lines within the silhouette. These incisions act as the details/lighter colour
        * can do musculature, etc.
    + around this time, artists began to adapt to the curvature of the pottery in their art
- __Red-figure (530- BC)__
    + Instead of painting the figure of the slip, and firing it like in black-figure, the artist paints the background with slip
    + Details and fine-lines are painted in slip as well, and then fired
    + Developed in Athens. Corinth had lost its dominance by this point
        - Athens dominated trade before Red-figure had been developed
    + Advantages
        * black-figure makes everything look blank (the background would be empty)
        * in red-figure, the background looks "full" because it has colour. It's a more striking way to present art, since the contrast works for it rather than against it
    + Since the Geometric era, the Greeks had been trying to make their figures more and more realistic
    + Note about realism in art
        * Plato felt realism in art was deceptive, because art is not physically real.

**Themes**

1. Orientalizing period
    * floral/vegetal and animal motifs predominated
2. 7th-6th century BC
    * Athenians began trend toward mythological themes
3. Late 6th century BC
    * contemporary scenes
        - athletics, symposia, school, pederastic courtship
    * problem of interpretation(?)
        - sometimes, there'd be multiple interpretations and people wouldn't know which one was "correct"
        - is this a problem with the mythological themes of 7th-6th century BC, or with contemporary late 6th century scenes?
