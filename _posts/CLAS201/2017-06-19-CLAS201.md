### GREEK PHILOSOPHY


#### I. NATURAL PHILOSOPHERS (PRE-SOCRATICS)

##### A) New Way of Explaining the World

* Philosophers were originally called "Fusacois"
    - Naturalists, who tried to explain the world in a natural way
    - These philosophers were reductionists
        + Wanted to reduce everything into the simplest form
        + Figure out the one thing that everything comes from and is made one

1. Based on rationality
    * The poets were the ones who "knew" about the creation of the world
        - They were inspired by the gods (maybe Apollo, or Zeus), mostly by the Muses
            + Hesiod was inspired by the gods and divine revelation
    * Natural philosophers just looked at the world, observed it, and thought about it a lot
        - Though, modern scientists did more thinking that looking
    * Thales, predicting an eclipse v. Hesiod's inspiration by the Muses
        - Probably got his information from the East
            + Babylonians knew about celestial movements
        - Thales figured, if you had this knowledge of how the world works, you can predict things
        - The Greeks would say the gods were angry if there was an eclipse, but Thales said this was a natural occurrence
            + Didn't have to attribute everything to the gods
                * This ideal is the main difference
2. Critical thinking
    * Natural philosophers would typically write their ideas down, and disseminate them
        - Other philosophers would look at these ideas, and interact with them, and figure out why they might be mistaken
    * Hesiod acknowledged that, sometimes, Muses tell lies
        - There were other versions of the creation of the world that was circulating.
        - Sometimes, Muses don't give as accurate information
    * Alternate views were debated and critiqued
    * Natural philosophers wrote in prose, suggesting they were not inspired, but rather their ideas came from thinking within themselves

__Note__

None of these natural philosophers' work survived. Our only records of them are quotes and explanations of later writers.

* Thales was esp. hard to figure out

##### Search for the *Arche*

Arche refers to some origin, source, basis

1. Concrete ideas
    * Water (Thales)
        - The world rested on water, and maybe was composed of water
        - Mythical ideas suggest that water is the arche
            + seems like Thales might have been inspired by these ideas
    * Aer (Anaximenes)
        - Aer is the Greek translation of air, but it probably refered to something other than just air
        - ...
2. Abstract
    * The boundless (Anaximander)
        - ...
    * Number (Pythagoras)
        - Pythagoras saw numerical patterns in everything (even when it probably didn't exist)
        - Not such a weird idea, to be quite fair
            + To understand the universe, we need to understand mathematics and numbers
    * Fire & *logos* (Heraclitus)
        - "Everything flows."
            + Heraclitus sometimes sounds profound and wise, but other times sounds strange
                * Very enigmatic
        - Said a divine fire was the arche
            + logos refers to story/orderly narrative
                * suggested there's some order to the universe
    * Mind/*Nous* (Anaxagoras)
        - Anaxagoras was an Athenian natural philosopher

__Notes__

* The natural philosophers didn't really get anywhere with their ideas. It seemed like everybody had their own ideas of how the world worked.

##### C) Change versus Statis

* Some philosohpers felt that Change was the essence of the universe
    - eg. Heraclitus, "Everything flows."
        + The universe is in constant change
        + So maybe fire is the arche because it's active and always changing
    - Parmenides, "Being is all. Ergo, reality consists simple of indivisible, changeless, featureless, rock-solid Being."
        + The arche has to be "Being"
            * That which is, is
        + Any change is an "illusion"
            * ...


#### II. SOPHISTS

##### A) Relativism

1. Protagoras
    * "Man is the measure of all things."
2. Law/Nature (*Nomos*/*physis*) dichotomy
    * conventions have crept into human society as they have tried to organize their society
        - all these ideas that manifest as laws or ethical principles don't really reflect nature as it really is
        - sometimes, adhering to convention and law goes against nature, and vice versa
    * cf. Slaves, barbarians, women
        - overthrows conventional way of thinking

##### B) Educational Mission

1. Practical success
    * wanted to teach people how to live successful lives
    * "What I teach is sound deliberation, both in domestic matter—how best to manage one's household, and in public affairs—how to realize one's maximum potential for success in political debate and action"
        - Plato, *Protagoras*, 318e-319a
2. Rhetoric
    * ...


#### III. CLASSICAL PHILOSOPHY

__Introduction__

* The term *philosophia*/*philosophos*: referred to "love of wisdom"
    - cf. *sophos* and *sophistes*
        + the former, wisdom
        + the latter, a wise person. Where we get sophists from, in English
* In the 300s BC, we have Platos and Aristotle, etc
    - The term phisolophy took on a life of its own, and there was lots of contention regarding it
        + phisolophy became a word that everyone wanted to claim, because it represented everything good about wisdom and knowledge
            * like democracy, today. Everybody wants to claim they're democratic, but it seems like many different people have different ideas of democracy

##### A) Socrates

1. Who was Socrates?
    * physikos, sophist, or something new?
        - cf. The Clouds
2. Practices
    * Socratic Irony
        - *The Apology*
            + the wisest person is the one who knows that he knows nothing
            + Everywhere Socrates went, he'd ask "why do you think ..."
                * people would give an answer, and Socrates would subvert everything they said
                * when people asked Socrates what he thought things were, he'd say he doesn't know
    * Dialectic
        - ask questions (especially of experts), challenge assumptions, seek a universal definition
        - always a dialogue to try to figure out what was true

##### B) Other "Philosophers"

People didn't recognize these people as philosophers

1. Xenophon
    * wrote socratic dialogue
    * was too practical, and mostly talked about ethical things, rather than profound metaphisms like Plato did
    * would have said he was a philosopher
        - cf. *Apology*
2. Isocrates
    * humans as logical/rational beings
    * ...

##### C) Plato

1. Dialectic not Rhetoric, episteme (knowledge) not doxai
    * Plato would just have dialogue over and over, and doesn't really present much episteme
        - Plato said you needed episteme in order to find truth, but never really got it...
    * doxai are opinions, and Isocrates was based on doxai
2. Idealism
    * The changing world is the world we live in
        - "What is a chair?"
            + Different chairs share some kind of "higher connection" of chairness
                * in the ideal world, we find this connection. It participates in the unchanging nature of the idea world.
                * Chairness doesn't change
    * cf. Parmenides
    * Plato never came to settle with ideas. He focused on the dialectic nature of coming up with ideas
3. Influence
    * "The safest general characterization of the philosophical tradition is that is consists of a series of footnotes to Plato."
        - Alfred North Whitehead

##### D) Aristotle

1. Approach
    * ditched Plato's idealism
    * the ultimate good is not just transcendent but also immanent
    * collects and examines specimens
        - and draws conclusions from numerous separate cases
        - rather than saying there's an idea of fishness unchanging, Aristotle looked at specimens in the natural world
            + biological, constitutional, books, etc
