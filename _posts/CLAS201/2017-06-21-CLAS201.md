### THE RISE OF MACEDONIA


#### I. EARLY HISTORY OF MACEDONIA

##### A) Amyntas I (512 BC)

* Ally/vassal of Persia

##### B) Alexander I (498-454 BC)

* As well as the other 5th century kings
* The Hellenizing of Macedonia
    - NB. Euripides died in Macedon
        + Got sick of Athens, and was invited to Macedon by the King to write and put on plays
* Sometimes, during the Peloponnesian War, Macedonians were allies with Athens, sometimes not

##### C) Early Fourth Century (300s)

* Post-Peloponnesian War
* Much instability
    - 8 Kings from 400-359 BC
    - Was being pressed by the tribes around them, as well as the Greeks on the coast
    - A lot of Macedonians were not monogamists
        + Kings liked to have lots of wives, which resulted in lots of kids
        + In the early 300s, had lots of infighting in the Macedonian royal family
            * too many cousins and brothers vying for the throne


#### II. MACEDONIANS: GREEKS OR BARBARIANS?

##### A) Language is a little ambiguous
* Surviving inscriptions suggest that Macedonians spoke a language that was closely related to that of the Northwest Greeks
    - Lots of dialects, like Ionian, Dorian, etc...
* Some stories suggest that when Greeks tried to talk to the Macedonians, they couldn't understand them.

##### B) Culture

* Government(s) of Macedonia was not like the city states of the Greeks
* Like a __feudal system__
    - Kings ruled, with some loyal nobles
        + Homeric leadership
            * Multiple kings; a high king, and some lower kings. The lower kings wouldn't always be loyal to the high king
            * Macedonians looked Greek in their government only in their primitive Homeric style
                - 1 king, and other lesser kings subservant to the high king
    - the Monarchy was the state
        * the kingdom/country is embodied in the King
            - unlike the Greek city states, which had a highly developed sense of citizenship
    - cf. Greeks had a very different, republican government
        + Macedonians looked down on them for not having a good gov't
* __Cultural practices__
    - polygamy (not monogamy)
        + cf. Philip's marriages
        + Tumulus burials


##### C) Opinions of Other Greeks

* Alexander I applied for the Olympic games
    - But Greeks looked at him and said he was not Greek.
    - Greeks were convinced, because the royal family of Macedonia descended from the royal family of Argos
* Herodotus
    - Doric Greeks
* Isocrates
    - Greeks, Macedonians & barbarians
* Demosthenes
    - Barbarians

##### D) Modern Controversy

...


#### IV. PHILIP II (359-336 BC)

##### A) Accession and Survival

1. Hostage in Thebes (369-367 BC)
    * sent home when brother Alexander II was murdered
2. Became regent/king in 359BC after disastrous battle against the Illyrians (and death of brother Perdiccas III)
3. Made peace with Athens and Thrace, attacked Paeonians and Illyrians, made alliance with Epirus (Olympias)
    * There were a number of pretenders/cousins in Thrace, and the state was considering supporting one of them
        - However, Philip II convinced them not to, and to support him instead

##### B) Reforms and Innovations

1. Military
    * Developed new siege techniques with torsion catapults and elite corps of engineers
        - Philip II was very aggressive, and wanted to take over resistant cities
    * Macedonian phalanx
2. Administrative
    * Royal Pages
        - consolidated his hold over the nobility
        - a way of training/educating young people to be administrators and leaders in his government
            + somewhat sinister, because these Pages were like hostages
            + Philip II controlled these noblemen, whose sons were the Pages
                * Should these noblemen rebel, their sons would probably not be safe
    * Expanded the *hetairoi* and added the *pezetairoi*
        - hetairos means *companion* in Greek
        - Philip II wanted to mobilize the common people more effectively in his army (using the Macedonian Phalanx)
            + the pezetairoi let these common people gain a little favour with the king, allowing Philip II to build a more expansive army
            + this centralized Philip's power

##### C) Expansion

1. Constant expansion by astute diplomacy and successful military ventures
    * eventually conquered all of Greece in 338 BC
        - Epirus
            + Macedonia didn't necessarily conquer Epirus, but they formed a strong alliance
                * they had similar cultures, etc
        - Thessaly
2. Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)
    * Macedonia v. Thebes & Athens
        - two rather powerful Greek states, but Philip II beat them pretty badly
            + treated Thebans harshly and severely.
                * Demanded all the people who had opposed him to be executed or exiled.
                * Families of hostages from Thebans were given a high ransom
            + treated Athens much more leniently
                * Marched the fallen soldiers of Athens back to their state
                * Gave their hostages back
                * May have been due to a high level of respect for Athens as a center of culture
                    - Or maybe political, because Athens had a significant navy, which Philip II needed
                    - Philip wanted to conquer Persia, and he needed a navy to do so
    * League of Corinth (Hellenic League)
        - for peace in Greece and war against Persia
            + NB. the 4th c. appeal of a pan-Hellenic expedition against Persia
                * This new Hellenic League was like the old one, with a similar purpose: to fight against Persia
                * This naming allowed Greeks to rally behind it, given their old animosity towards Persia
        - Sparta was not included. They were rather secluded in nature, and their power had severely decreased by this point
        - Historians now call it the League of Corinth, as it was formed in Corinth.
            + And reduces confusion (there are 2 Hellenic Leagues)
                * Philip called it the same thing for political reasons
        - If the Greeks wanted to get out of their 4th c. funk, they needed to unite
            + Isocrates wrote about practical issues, like how the Greeks needed to (unite and) defeat Persia
                * too many Greek young men doing nothing, hired as mercenaries by various Greek states and Persia itself
                * war against Persia could solve the in-fighting between states, if all states united against Persia
    
##### D) Death of Philip II

* By 363 BC, Philip II died (quite quickly after the Battle of Chaeronea)
    - by this point, he controlled practically everything
        + except Sparta
        + except a few independent Greek states near Byzantium
* Two accounts of his death
    - one personal
        + Philip was holding a public ceremony in one of his capitals. One of his bodyguards assassinated him
        + Pausanias (former lover) and Attalus
            * Philip didn't want to piss off Attalus, one of his powerful nobles, didn't punish him.
            * He tells Pausanias to become one of his bodyguards
                - Probably a bad move, since Pausanias was still pissed off
    - one political
        + Philip had married quite a number of times. A few Thessalians, a Scythian, etc
            * These were all political marriages
            * To build power in Thessaly, he married a few Thessalian noblewomen
        + The last marriage was for love, and this was considered a mistake
            * Fell in love with a young Cleopatra, the neice of Attalus
            * Alexander the Great had been designated the heir of Macedonia, however, this marriage to Cleopatra put Olympias and Alexander's position in danger
                - the latter fled Macedonia, and plotted the murder of Philip II, to prevent an heir through Cleopatra
            * This story doesn't exclude the personal aspect of the assassination
