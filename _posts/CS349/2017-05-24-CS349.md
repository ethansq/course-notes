### MODERN GUI SYSTEMS

...



### JAVA GUI PROGRAMMING

A quick-start guide to building Swing applications


#### The Java Platform

##### Everything Is A Class

* Classes, objects are core language constructs
* Object-oriented features
    - polymorphism, encapsulation, inheritance
* Static and member variables and methods
* Resembles C++
    - Differences
        + no pointers
        + no type ambiguity
        + no destructor
        + single inheritance model

##### JDK [L7_S14]

##### Classes and Packages [S8_S16]

##### Class Hierarchy

* Implicit class hierarchy
    - All classes in Java are derived from the Object class
        + clone(), toString(), finalize()
    - Classes you write will inherit this basic behaviour

#### Initiating Objects

* Primitive types are allocated on the stack, passed by value
* Objects are allocated on the heap, passed by reference
    - technically, the value of address passed on the stack, but this behaves like pass-by-reference
    - practically, this means you don't need to worry about pointer semantics in parameter passing
        + `Bicycle my_bike = new Bicycle();`
        + `Bicycle kids_bike = my_bike`
            * both refer to the same memory on the heap

#### Composition: Inner Classes

```
class ShadowTest {
    public int x = 0;

    class FirstLevel {
        public int x = 1;

        void method(int x) {
            print("ShadowTest.this.x="+ShadowTest.this.x);
            // 0
            print(x); // watch the scope
            // 23
        }
    }

    public static void main(String... args) {
        ShadowTest st = new ShadowTest();
        ShadowTest.FirstLevel f = st.new FirstLevel();
        f.method(23);
    }
}
```

#### Inheritance & Subtype Polymorphism

Increase code reusability by allowing a class to inherit some of its behaviour from a base class ("is-a" relationship)

* In Java, this is done by using the keyword **extend**
* Abstract classes can be extended. Their abstract methods must be implemented by the inheriting class, less the inheriting class is also abstract

Java only supports single inheritance

* In practice, this simplifies the language
    - the "Diamond Problem"
        + class D inherits from B and C
        + classes B and C inherit from class A
        + D inherits A twice?
* It's very common in Java to derive an existing class and override behaviour
* All classes have Object as their ultimate base class (implicit)

#### Interfaces

An interface represents a set of methods that must be implemented by a class (a contract or blueprint). Somewhat similar to pure abstract classes/methods

* Cannot be instantiated
* Class implementing the interface must implement **all** methods in the interface
* Uses **implements** keyword

In Java,

* *extend* a class to derive functionality from it
* *implement* an interface when you want to enforce a specific API



### BUILDING USER INTERFACES

* Swing components
* Creating a window
* Adding Swing components


#### Java UI Toolkits

1. AWT (1995)
    * "Heavyweight" with platform-specific widgets
    * AWT applications were limited to common-functionality that existed on all platforms
2. Swing (1997)
    * "Lightweight", full widget implementation
    * Commonly used and deployed cross-platform
3. Standard Window Toolkit (SWT, ~2000)
4. Java FX (~2010)
    * Cleaner and richer than Swing
    * Intended for rich desktop+mobile applications
    * Still seeking market space


#### Building a Swing UI

1. Create a top-level application window using a Swing container
    * __JFrame__ or __JDialog__
2. Add Swing components to this window
    * typically, you create a smaller container (like __JPanel__) and add components to the panel
        - this makes dynamic layouts easier
3. Register for events
    * add listeners, like keyboard presses and mouse moves/clicks
    * implement actual behaviour for event callbacks
4. Make components update and paint themselves based on events


#### Creating a Window

```
import javax.swing.\*;

public class BasicForm1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // create a window
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("Layout Demo");
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);

        // create a panel and add components
        // all Swing components are types of JComponent
        JPanel panel = new JPanel();
        JButton b = new JButton("OK");
        panel.add(button);
        frame.add(panel);

        frame.setResizable(false);
        frame.setSize(200,200);

        frame.setVisible(true);
    }
}
```
