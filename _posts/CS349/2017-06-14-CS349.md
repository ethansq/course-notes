### AFFINE TRANSFORMATIONS

We can think of widgets as shape models

* Consists of an array of points `{P1, P2, ..., Pn}`
* Has properties describing how to draw it
* eg. Button
    - Points (0,0), (10,0), (5,0), (10,5)
    - Properties
        + text=OK
        + border_width=1
        + border_colour=blue


#### The Interactor Tree

Describes the hierachy of widgets

* Widget location is always specified in terms of parent's coordinate system (ie. relative/local coordinates)
    - need to do some math before painting
    - performing hit test requires taking parent location into consideration

We will use affine transformations with an interactor tree to...

* Manipulate and transform widgets (shape models)
* Tell widgets how to draw themselves on-screen, relative to their parent
* Determine if a mouse-click intersects one of these widgets in the interactor tree


How to create multiple instances of a shape?

* Rotation + Scaling + Translation

##### Translate

Add a scalar to each of the components (each point of the shape)

```
x' = x + t(x)
y' = y + t(y)
```

##### Uniform Scaling

Multiply each component (each point) by the same scalar

```
x' = x * s
y' = y * s
```

##### Non-uniform Scaling

Multiple each component (each point) by a different scalar

```
x' = x * s(x)
y' = y * s(y)
```

##### Rotation

Each component is some function of x, y, THETA

```
x' = f(x,y,THETA) = xcos(THETA) - ysin(THETA)
y' = f(x,y,THETA) = xsin(THETA) + ycos(THETA)
```


#### Benefits

* Allows reuse of objects in scenes
    - Can create multiple instances by translating model of object and re-rendering
* Allows specification of object in its own coordinate system
    - Don't need to define object in terms of its screen location or orientation
* Simplifies remapping of models after a change
    - eg. Animation


#### Examples

__Combining Transformations [L16_S11]__

We want to paint the house 2x its size, up the 30 degree slanted hill

* Strategy
    - scale
        + `x=2x; y=2y;`
    - rotate
        + `x=2(xcos(30) - ysin(30)); y=2(xsin(30) + ycos(30));`
    - translate
        + `x=...+8; y=...+4;`
* If we rotated after translation, our rotation would move the house as well as rotate it, which is not what we want

__Combining Transformations [L16_S16]__

* Strategy
    - Need to rotate bubble (45 degrees) about its center
        + need to translate in a way that the center of the shape is at the origin
        + translate after
    - Need to scale the size of person
        + 2X
    - Need to translate person
        + 40px, 0px
    - Need to translate bubble
        + 60px, 30px



### MATRIX REPRESENTATION


#### Linear Algebra

* (s) Scalar
    - a single value (usually a real number)
* (v) Vector
    - A representation of an ordered list of numbers 
    - Matrix
        + a vector arranged in rows and columns
    - Row/Column vector
        + a matrix with just one dimension
* (P) Point
    - A fixed location in spcae (represents a position)

__Legal Operations__

* vector + vector: v1 + v2 = v3
* vector multiplied by scalar: v1 x s1 = v4
* point minus point = P1 - P2 = v5
* point + vector: P2 + v5 = P1
* 2 ways to "multiply" vector by vector
    - dot product: v1 * v2 = s2
    - cross product: v1 * v2 = v6

__Goal__

Represent each 2D transformation with a matrix

* This is a succinct way of expressing a single transformation that can be used to transform all of the points in our shape model

```
| a b |
| c d |

Multiply matrix by a column vector => apply transformation to a point

x' = ax + by
y' = cx + dy

| x' | = | a b || x |
| y' |   | c d || y |
```

Matrix notation also supports combining transformations by multiplication

* ie. transformations are associative
* We can multiply transformation matrices together
    - This single matrix can then be used to transform many points
    - Can be sent to a GPU to speed up the process


#### Improvements

...

__Examination__

* Will need to be comfortable with matrix multiplication
    - given a series of transformation matricies, what is the final transformation matrix?
    - given a final transformation matrix, what were the operations?

__Notes__

* Matrices are associative
    * A(BC) = (AB)C
* Matrices are not commutative
    * AB != BC
