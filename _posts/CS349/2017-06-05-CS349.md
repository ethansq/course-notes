### Widgets

A generic name for parts of an interface that have their own behaviour

* e.g. buttons, progress bars, sliders, etc
* Widgets are also called __components__ or __controls__
    - they control their own appearance
    - they receive and interpret their own events
* Are often put into libraries (toolkits) or reuse
    - Software bundled with a window manager, operating system, development language, hardware platform
    - The toolkit defines a set of GUI components for programmers
        + Programmers access these GUI components via an API

#### Widget Toolkit Design Goals

1. Complete
    * Complete set of widgets and functionality
    * Goal: GUI designers have everything they need
2. Consistent
    * User: Look and Feel is consistent across components
    * Developer: Consistent usage paradigms
3. Customizable
    * Developer can reasonably extend functionality to meet particular needs of application

Meeting these requirements encourages reuse

##### Completeness

The Macintosh 7 had a button, slider, pull-down menu, checkbox, radio button, text entry fields, and a file I/O widget.

* Java Swing has many, many more.
    - SwingSet Demo
        + shows lots of different widgets with lots of variations
        + can easily view source code
            * to run, download examples, and run `$ ant SwingSet2`

##### Consistency

Facilitate learning by

* Using a common look and feel
    - Look: consistent visual appearance
    - Feel: consistent and expected behaviour
* Using widgets appropriately

Consistency helps users anticipate how the interface will react, and promotes easier discoverability of features

* For example, users familiar with Windows Vista will/can recognize features of the Vista platform.
* This is not very transferable to Java Swing, because Swing isn't very recognizable in general.
* Moreover, people expect widgets to behave in certain ways
    - When we want to "Confirm" authentication, for example, we expect to left-click an Ok or Agree button, not right-click some obscure widget.
        + User should not guess

##### Customizable

How do we customize widget behaviour and appearance?

1. Properties
    * e.g. change colour, font, orientation, text formatter, ...
2. Factor our behaviour (Pluggable behaviour)
    * Responding to an action: ActionListener
    * Swing's UIManager for changing look and feel
    * JTable example

More on customizability later
