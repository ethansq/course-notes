### Event Handling

How to manage event-code binding

- Switch Statement Binding
- Inheritance Binding
- Event Interfaces & Listeners
- Delegate Binding

After dispatch to a widget, how do we bind an event to code?


#### Event-to-Code Binding

How do we design our GUI architecture to enable application logic to interpret events once they've arrived at the widget?

* Design Goals
    - Easy to understand (clear connection between each event and code that will execute)
    - Easy to implement (binding paradigm or API)
    - Easy to debug
    - Good performance


#### Event Loop and Switch Statement Binding (X11)

All application events are consumed in one event loop (not by the widgets themselves)

* Outer switch statement selects window and inner switch selects code to handle the event
* Used in Xlib, Apple System 7, and, until recently, Blender


##### WindowProc Binding (MS Windows)

* Each window registers a WindowProc function (Window Procedure) which is called each time an event is dispatched
* The WindowProc uses a switch statement to identify each event that it needs to handle
    - there are hundreds of standard events


#### Inheritance Binding

##### Java Event Handling

Java simplifies much of event handling

* Events are transmitted to onscreen objects without programming intervention
* The event loop is hidden and managed by the JVM
* To handle events, tell onscreen objects what you're interested in and what to do when the event fires.

##### Inheritance Binding (Java 1.0, OSX)

Event is dispatched to an Object-Oriented Widget
    
* These widgets inherit from a base widget class with all event handling methods defined a priori
    - `onMousePress`, `onMouseMove`, `onKeyPress`, etc
* The widget overrides methods for events it wishes to handle
    - each method handles multiple related events

##### Inheritance Problems

1. Each widget handles its own events, or the widget container has to check what widget the event is meant for
2. Multiple event types are processed thru each event method
    * complex and error-prone
    * another switch statement
3. No filtering of events
    * performance issues (esp. with frequent events)
4. Does not scale well. How do we add new events?
    * e.g. penButtonPress, touchGesture
5. Muddies separation between GUI and application logic
    * event handling application code is in the inherited widget
    * **Use inheritance for extending class functionality, not for binding events**


#### Event Interfaces & Listeners

Rather than a subclass widget, define an interface for event handling

* Here, an interface refers to a set of functions or method signatures for handling specific types of events
    - e.g. in Java, can define an interface for handling mouse events
* Can then create a class that implements that interface by implementing methods for handling these mouse events
* Widget object implements event "listener" interfaces
    - e.g. MouseListener, MouseMotionListener, KeyListener, etc
* When event is dispatched to widget, the relevant listener method is called

##### Improvements

1. Each event type assigned to an event method
2. Events are filtered
    - only sent to object which implements interface
3. Easy to scale to new events

##### Problems

1. Each widget handles its own events, or widget container has to check what widget the event is meant for
2. Muddies separation between GUI and application logic
    * event handling application code is in inherited widget

##### Listener Object Binding

##### Listener Adapter Pattern

* Many listener interfaces have only a single method
    - e.g. ActionListener only has `actionPerformed()`
* Other listener interfaces have several methods
    - Typically, only interested in a few of them, not all
    - This leads to lots of boilerplate code with no-op methods
* Each listener w/ multiple methods has an adapter class with no-op methods
    - Simply extend the adapter, overriding only the methods of interest


#### Delegate Binding

Interface architecture can be a bit heavyweight

* Can instead have something closer to a simple function callback
* Delegates in Microsoft's .NET are like a C/C++ funciton pointer for methods. However, they are
    - Object-oriented
    - Completely type-checked
    - More secure
    - Support multicasting (able to point to more than one method)
* Using delegates is a way to broadcast and subscribe to events

##### Using Delegates

1. Declare a delegate using a method signature
2. Declare a delegate object
3. Instantiate the delegate with a method
4. Invoke the delegate

##### Multicasting

* Instantiate more than one method for a delegate object
```
handler = MyMethod1 + MyMethod2;
handler += MyMethod3;
```

* Invoke the delegate, calling all methods
```
handler("Hello");
```
* Remove method from a delegate object
```
handler -= MyMethod1;
```

* How about
```
handler = MyMethod4;
```
