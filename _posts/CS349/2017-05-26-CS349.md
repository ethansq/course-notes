### BASIC GUI DRAWING


#### Local Coordinates

* Any modern OS manages multiple windows
* Base Window System manages
    - where the window is located
    - whether it is covered by another window, etc
    - enables drawing using local coordinate system for the window


#### Conceptual Drawing Models

1. Pixel
    * `SetPixel(x,y,colour)`
    * `DrawImage(x,y,w,h,img)`
2. Stroke
3. Region

...



### DRAWING IN JAVA

* Overriding `painComponent()`
* Graphics object


#### Graphics and Painting

* Applications consist of a JFrame (window), containing one or more Swing components
* We often define a top-level canvas (container)
    - this can hold other components
        + text fields, buttons, scrollbars, etc
    - we can also draw directly on the canvas
* Each component has a `paintComponent()` method, which describes how it paints itself
    - You can override this method, and draw primitive objects using the `java.awt.Graphics` object (basically, the Graphics Context)
    - This is a common technique for defining drawables in Java
* see L9_S21,22 for some code



### EVENTS

* User interface architectures need to be able to accept input from real-world devices, and map them to actions within a system
    - support the transformation of input into commands
    - we want a general, reusable architecture that supports multiple devices


#### Event-Driven Programming

> Event-driven programming is a paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs, or messages from other programs/threads.
> 
> Wikipedia

* An event is a message to notify an application that something happened
    - e.g key press, key release, mouse move, mouse click, focus gained, focus lost, timer done, etc.


#### Role of the BWS, WM

1. Collect event information
2. Put relevant information in a known structure
3. Order the events by time
4. Decide which application and window should ge the event
5. Deliver the event

#### Role of the Programmer

1. Indicate what events you are interested in to the BWS/WM, to ensure that events are delivered
2. Write code
    * register to receive events
    * receive and interpret those types of events
    * update program content based on event
    * redraw the display (provide feedback) to communicate to the user what had changed
3. In modern languages, the process of registering for events and handling events is simplified
    * Java: Listener model
    * C#: Delegate model
    * Javascript: Something else



### Event Dispatch

Event Capture, processing, and dispatch

* The event dispatch stage includes
    - Event dispatch
        + getting events to the correct widget
    - Event handling
        + running code for an event
    - Notify view and windowing system
        + MVC, and view notification
* The Event loop is the primary mechanism for event dispatch within an application
    - the event loop can be managed by application (XLib) or the toolkit (JVM)
    - the event loop iterates through all events in the event queue, and pushes them in order to the appropriate application
    - the application needs to determine which component should process the event
    - widget are often the final target of events dispatched from the event loop
* Once delivered to a widget, it still needs to interpret what any of the input means in the proper context and react appropriately


#### Widget Layout

* In complex applications, widgets are often laid out in a hierarchy
    - We call this hierarchy an interactor tree
    - Container classes and low-level components are nested together
    - Dispatching an event to the correct widget (that can handle the event) means traversing this tree


#### Lightweight v. Heavyweight Widgets [L10_S17]

##### Heavyweight widgets

* Widget toolkit wraps native-OS widgets
* BWS/OS provides a hierarchical "windowing" system for all widgets across all applications, and treats a widget essentially as a window
* This allows the BWS to dispatch events to a specific widget (and not just the top-level window)
* nested X Windows, Java's AWT, standard HTML form widgets, Windows MFC

##### Lightweight widgets

* The widget toolkit draws its own widgets and is responsible for mapping incoming events to widgets
* BWS/OS provides a top-level window only, and can only dispatch to the window (NOT the widget)
* Java Swing, JQuery UI, Windows WPF


#### Positional Dispatch

* Send input to the widget under the mouse cursor
* The front-most widget under the cursor should receive the event

Widgets can overlap, so how do we determine the appropriate target widget?

##### Bottom-up positional dispatch

* Event is first routed to **leaf node widget in the interactor tree** corresponding to location of mouse cursor
* Leaf node has first opportunity to act on that event
* The leaf node widget can either
    - process the event itself
    - pass the event to its parent (who can process it and/or send it to its parent)
        + Why would a widget pass an event to its parent?
        + e.g. a palette of colour swatches may implement the colours as buttons. But palette needs to track the currently selected colour. This is easier if the palette deals with the events, rather than the button

##### Top-down positional dispatch

* Event is routed to widget in the highest-level node in the interactor tree that contains the mouse cursor
    - can process the event itself
    - can pass it on to a child component
* Key idea is that the highest-level node has the first chance at acting on the event
    - can create policies enforced by the parent
        + e.g. stopping events if all children are disabled
    - supports relatively easy logging of events for later replay

##### Limitations

Positional dispatch can lead to odd behaviour

* Example, we normally send keystrokes to scrollbar if the mouse is over the scrollbar
    - What if the mouse-drag starts in a scrollbar, but moves outside of it as it drags? Do we continue sending the events to the scrollbar? To the adjacent widget instead?
    - What if the mouse-press event occurs over one button but the release is over another widget? Does each widget get one of the events?
* SOmetimes, position isn't enough. Also need to keep track of focus


#### Focus Dispatch

...


#### Accelerator Key Dispatch

...


#### Toolkit Summary

* BWS and widgets cooperate to dispatch events
    - **heavyweight**
        + BWS has visibility into all widgets in the application
        + BWS can dispatch top-down or bottom-up
    - **lightweight**
        + BWS can dispatch top-down only
        + toolkit dispatches to the widget
            * in Java, the JVM manages the dispatch


#### Dispatch Summary

* Mouse-down events are almost always positional
    - dispatched to widget under cursor (top-down or bottom-up)
* Other mouse and keyboard events go to widget in focus
* Positional and focus dispatch work together
