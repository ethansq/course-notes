### WINDOWING SYSTEMS

Windowing functions
Base Window System v. Window Manager


#### GUI Characteristics

* GUI architectures share common characteristics
    - support output to a graphical display
        + display text/high-resolution graphics
    - Handle user input from multiple devices
        + minimally, keyboard (text) and a positional input device (mouse)
    - Provide an interface to display/manipulate content
        + Most modern GUIs use a desktop metaphor
            * windows contain data and can be manipulated (resized, moved, overlap, etc)
        + Common GUI elements: scrollbars, buttons, etc
* A __windowing system__ provides input, output, and window management capabilities to the operating system
    - Before windowing systems, systems typically ran a single application, which dominated the screen (DOS, BIOS, etc)
    - With windowing systems, programs can run simultaneously, each with their own separate window. Windows may exist side-by-side, or overlap. Input is directed to the focused/correct window by the windowing system


#### Base Window System (BWS)

* Lowest level abstraction for windowing system
    - routines for creating, destroying, and managing windows
* Routes mouse and keyboard input to correct window
    - only one window has focus to receive input
* Ensures only one application changing frame buffer (video memory) at a time
    - one reason single-threaded/non-thread-safe GUI architectures are popular
* The BWS provides each program with a window, and manages access to that window
    - the BWS provides a __drawing canvas__ abstraction
    - The application is shielded from details of frame buffer, visibility of the window, and all other application windows
    - each window has own coordinate system
        + BWS transforms between global (screen) and local (window) coordinate systems
        + Each window does not need to worry where it is on screen. Its top-left is (0,0)
    - BWS provides graphics routines to the program for drawing


#### Window Manager

* Provides conceptually different functionality
    - layered on top of BWS
    - provides interactive components for windows (menus, close box, resize capabilities)
    - creates the look and feel of each window
* Application "owns" the contents of the window, but the window manager owns the application itself

Application Window v. Application "Canvas"

* The window manager owns the window (including its controls)
    - the close, minimize, fullscreen buttons
    - the application title
    - the window frame
* the application owns the canvas


#### Types of Window Managers

1. Tiling Window Manager
    * paints all windows by placing them side-by-side or above and below each other
    * There is no window overlap
2. Stacking Window Manager
    * Allows windows to overlap by drawing background windows first, then drawing the foreground windows on top of them
3. Compositing Window Manager
    * Lets all windows be drawn separately, and then puts them all together and draws them all using 2D or 3D techniques
    * More complex, but provides extra functionality
        - e.g. cascading visuals when alt-tabbing
        - e.g. partial transparency of windows


#### BWS v. Window Managers

1. Unixes and Linuxes
    * separate the BWS and window manager
        - separation of BWS from WM:
            + enables many alternative looks and feels for the windowing system
            + one of the keys to X11's lasting power: can innovate by changing the WM layer
            + resiliency, since BWS and WM are separate processes
    * BWS: X Window System
    * Stacking WM: Fluxbox, Openbox, Window Maker, etc
    * Compositing WM; Compiz, KWin, etc
2. Windows Vista, 7, 8, 10 and MacOS combine the BWS and WM. Or, at least, doesn't distinguish between the two
    * Windows; Desktop Window Manager (BWS & Compositing WM)
    * MacOS; Quartz Compositor (BWS & Compositing WM)
    * Trade-offs in approaches?
        - Look and feel
        - Window management possibilities
        - Input possibilities

Conceptually, on both platforms, there is a separation of canvas (assigned to application) and window decoration/OS overlay handled by window manager

* Lines between do blur when combined, however
* e.g. Windows fast access menu-bar in the window frame



### X Windows (X11) System

* __Base windowing system__, separate from the operating system
    - not a window manager
    - does not specify the style of user interface
* What does it do?
    - A protocol to create windows, handle input, draw graphics
    - A standard for low-level graphical output and user input

#### Design Criteria

1. Implementable on a **variety of displays**
2. Applications must be **device independent**
3. Must be **network transparent**
4. Support **multiple, concurrent application displays**
5. Support many different applications
6. Support output to **overlapping windows** (even when partially obscured)
7. Support a hierarchy of **resizable windows** (an application can use many windows at once)
8. High performance, high-quality text, **2-D graphics**, imaging
9. System should be extensible

#### Displays, Screens, Windows

* In X, a display may have multiple screens
* A display may have multiple windows
* A window may cross multiple screens

#### X Client-Server Architecture [27]

...

#### Structure of a Typical X Program

1. Perform client initialization
2. Connect to the X server
3. Perform X related init
4. Event loop
    * get next event from the X server
    * handle the event
        - if the event was a quit message, exit
        - do any client-related work
    * send drawing requests to the X server
5. Close down the connection to the X server
6. Perform client cleanup

Xlib, an X Windows Library, is provided **[s31]**. Note that X is relatively complex.

#### Contrast: Opening a Window in Java

```
import javax.swing.\*;

public class TestWindow extends JFrame {
    public TextWindow() {
        this.setTitle(...)
        this.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT\_ON\_CLOSE);
    }
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        TestWindow myWindow = new TestWindow();
        myWindow.setSize(400,300);
        myWindow.setVisible(true);
    }
}
```

#### Recap: X Windows Design

* Much of XWindows architecture was influenced by its time period
    - larger server machines and low-cost client displays because computation was expensive
* As computation got cheaper, certain aspects of program behaviour could be assumed
