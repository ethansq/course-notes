### Design


#### A Design Process: User-Centered Design

To make things usable and useful, you need to understand the people who use your software

The philosophy

* Ask real __people__ what they need
* Ask __people__ what problems they have with current solution
* Think about the __people__ who will use your software
* Test your ideas with __people__

**Developers are not people**

##### Some History

Refined at Apple, with the Mac user-interface

**Process**

* User studies: bring in users, provide mockups, assess
* Implementation: iterate based on (agile) feedback
    - Fix problems, update solutions, etc
* Usability studies: more users, more video, more analysis

**Problems**

* Time: adds 1-2 years to the development cycle
* Changes: no "cutoff" for changes!

**Solutions**

* Manage through iteration (Agile process)

##### Principles

1. Understand the user's needs
    * Build a product that meets real needs rather than building it because it can be built
2. Design the UI first
    * Design the UI first, and then design the architecture to support the UI
3. Iterate
    * You won't create the best UI design on the first tr
    * A great design requires attention
4. Use it yourself
    * You'll find obvious problems that can be fixed while it's still easy to fix
        - If the development process goes too far, there are too many dependencies. It becomes difficult to make certain changes based on a lack of isolation
5. Observe others using it
    * It's critical to observe other people using your UI in a realistic way very early in the development cycle

We will not focus much on the "Design the Architecture", "Choose a set of scenarios", "Implement the Scenarios" sections.

##### A) Understand the user

1. Observe existing solutions
    * As well as what's wrong with them
2. List scenarios
    * Literally all the things your users want/need to do
    * Scenarios
        - are stories of people undertaking activities with technology
        - they are a natural way to think
            + easy to understand (for devs and users)
            + contain sequencing data(?)
        - must be refined/elaborated with appropriate detail
            + exactly what the user does
            + how UI changes in response
        - have pitfalls:
            + typically crowds out the exceptional use-cases and users
            + often fail to catch "oughts"
            + cannot be formalized (this is also a strength)
        - have variations
        - should be retained
            + written v. memorized v. generated on demand
3. List functions required by scenarios and prioritize functions
    * Some functions will be required by several scenarios
    * Prioritize
        - **Critical**, **Important**, or **Nice to have**
4. List functions by frequency and commonality
    * Frequent use by many
        - Visible, few clicks away
    * Frequent use by few
        - Suggested, few clicks
    * Occasional by many
        - Suggested, more clicks
    * Occasional by few
        - Hidden, more clicks away

##### B) Design the UI

* Identify/design widgets (components) and widget types to support prioritized functionality
    - e.g. text fields, buttons, etc
* Balance functionality with well-understood widget types
    - i.e. customized control v. familiar controls
* Assign attributes
    - Model
        + what data does it need
    - Affordances
        + what can you do with it?
    - Presentation
        + how does it appear in the UI?

**Component Distribution**

* Temporal distribution
    - When components appear, the flow from one interface to another
* Spacing distribution
    - Where components appear on an individual interface section
    - Use visual design & Gestalt principles

Design the flow of the UI. Which screens lead to which, etc

**Storyboards**

* Quick way to sketch out sequences and schematics
    - could form the basis of a paper prototype
* Typically linked to a scenario

**Macro and Micro Structure**

* Interaction Sequences
    - macro-structure, convey the big picture of system interaction
    - e.g. Phone Book -- Add New Entry --> Edit Entry -- Submit --> Match to Existing Entry
    - uses labeled boxes and arrows, but sometimes a more extensive visual vocabulary may be helpful
* Interface Schematics
    - micro-structure, convey essentials and functionality at individual steps of interaction

Need both to describe a user interface

**Visual Vocabulary**

* A standard set of graphical symbols and notation to describe something
* Qualities of a good UI design visual vocabulary
    - Whiteboard-compatible
    - Tool-indepedent
    - Small and self-contained
* The UML tends to be too formal (too "high ceremony")
* [Jesse James Garret's visual vocabulary](http://www.jjg.net/ia/visvocab/)
    - Good, but web-centric
* Find a consisten visual vocabulary that works for you

**Interface Schematics**

* Includes enough detail so that someone could begin designing and implementing system logic
    - visual arrangement of content/information
    - functionality of interface (widgets, forms, data)
    - navigational and content elements ordered to convey structure and meaning
    - indicates the relative significance of all elements
* Interface schematics are not the same as
    - graphic design mockup
    - paper prototypes
* See notes for examples on interface schematics
