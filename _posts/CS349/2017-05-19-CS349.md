### PROTOTYPING

* Iteration and refinement
* Might take successive versions to "get it right"

Process

* User studies
    - bring in users, provide mockups, assess
* Implementation
    - iterate based on feedback
* Usability studies
    - more users, video, analysis

A limited representation of a design that allows people to interact with it and explore its suitability

* Goal: Maximum Feedback, Minimum Effort

Examples

* paper sketches/collage with "human computer processor"
* slide show or video simulating the use of a system
* physical model (wood, cardboard, etc.)
* software or hardware with limited functionality

##### Prototype Objectives

Build "working" prototype from design work

* Aid in discussions with stakeholders
* Help communication of ideas among team members
* For user evaluation
* For technical/layout testing and fine-tuning

##### What to Prototype?

Difficult, controversial, and critical areas

Possible aspects to test

1. Concepts and terminology
2. Nagivation, task flow
3. Mental models
4. Documentation, help
5. Layout, colours, fonts, graphic elements, "brand"
6. Custom widgets
7. Performance metrics
8. Technical feasibility
9. Usefulness

##### Fidelity

Faithfulness of prototype appearance and performance to final product

* Low
    - prototype doesn't look much like the final product. Operation may be simulated and slower
* High
    - prototype looks and operates like the real product

##### Paper Prototyping

> Usability Testing where representative users perform realistic tasks by interacting with a paper version of the interface that is manipulated by a person playing computer, who doesn't explain how the interface is intended to work.
> 
> Snyder, 2003, p. 4

##### Wizard of Oz Technique

Evaluate unimplemented technology by using a human to simulate the response of a system

* Much easier to do this technique than implement complex features

##### Paper Prototyping Image Quality

1. Rendering: How good should it look?
    * Good enough to elicit feedback about critical/risky design issues
2. Creation speed is of the essence
3. Modifications: When?
    * While user is present
    * Get immediate feedback. Make changes without losing users' context
    * Consider allowing the user to make changes
4. Coding effort in paper prototyping is **always zero**
5.  No code to write or rewrite until design is stabilized

##### Interactive Prototyping

Tools

1. Figma
2. Axure RP
3. Sketch
4. inVision
5. UXPin

##### Summary

Usability and usefulness are important properties that don't just happen. User Centered Design is a process:

* Understand the user needs
* Design the UI first
* Iterate on design
* Use it yourself
* Observe others using it
