### LAYOUTS


#### Two-Inteface Layout Tasks

1. Designing a spatial layout of widgets in a container
2. Adjusting the spatial layout when container is resized
    * Both can be done by hand (ie. graphic design)
    * or automatically (ie. with algorithms)

Spatial layout is one component of visual design

* It should use/maintain Gestalt principles
* It should use/maintain grouping, hierarchy, relationships, balance to achieve organization and structure


#### Dynamic Layout

* If a window is resized, we want to maximum use of available space for displaying widgets
* Hoeever, we want to do this such that the window maintains consistency with spatial layout
    - and preserves visual quality of spatial layout
* Need to dynamically modify the layout
    - reallocate space for widgets
    - adjust location and size of widgets
    - perhaps even change visibility, look, and/or feel of widgets

Moreover, widgets should be flexible to adjust for different screen sizes


#### Layout Managers

* A layout manager provies a layout algorithm to size and position its children widgets
    - Swing's package provides a number of them
        + Grid, Box, Border, Flow, GridBag, etc...
* A widget can set the most appropriate layout strategy
    - `container.setLayout(new GridLayout(2,3))`
* Layout Managers are most useful for container widgets like `JPanel` or `JScrollPane`

##### BorderLayout

* Places components in up to five areas
    - top, bottom, left, right, center

##### BoxLayout

* Puts components in a single row or column

##### CardLayout

* Lets you implement an area that contains different components at different times

##### FlowLayout

* Simply layous out components in a single row, starting a new row if its container is not sufficiently wide

##### GridBagLayout

* Flexible layout manager
* Aligns components by placing them within a grid of cells
    - Allows components to span more than one cell

##### GridLayout

 * Simply makes components equal in size and displays them in the requested number of rows and columns

##### GroupLayout

* Developed for use by GUI builder tools, but can be used manually
* Works with the horizontal and vertical layouts separately
* Layout is defined for each dimension independently

##### SpringLayout

* Flexible layout manager designed for use by GUI builders
* Lets you specify precise relationships between the edgers of components under its control
    - Struts
        + static in size
        + Struts between edges will remain the same when the screen size is changed
    - Springs
        + adjustable in size
        + Springs allow distances to change/adjust to screen size changes

##### CustomLayout

Can implement own layout manager...


#### Layout Design Patterns

##### Composite Pattern [L14_S13]

* Specifies that a group of objects are to be treated in the same way as a single instance of an object
* The intent of a composite is to "compose" objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
    - implementing the composite pattern allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly

##### Strategy Design Pattern [L14_S15]

* Factors out an algorithm into separate objects, allowing a client to dynamically switch algorithms
    - eg. Java Comparator "strategy" for a collection "context"
    - eg. Switching a game's move selection algorithm from "easy" to "hard"
    - eg. Text formatter for textboxes


#### FixedLayout

* Widgets have a fixed size and fixed position
* In Java, achieved by setting LayoutManager to null
* Where/when is this practical?
    - ...
* How can it break down even when windows aren't resized?
    - Adding new elements means updating the other elements, which were placed manually
    - Changing locales for text may cause the given widget size(s) to be too small


#### Intrinsic Size Layout [L14_S19]

* A bottom-up approach where top-level widget's size is completely dependent on its contained widgets
    - A bit of a stronger variant to `width:auto; height:auto;`
* Single pass algorithm
    - query each child widget for its preferred size
    - adjust the parent widget to perfectly contain each item
* BoxLayout and FlowLayout use this strategy


#### Variable Instrinsic Size Layout [L14_S20]

...


#### Struts and Springs Layout [L14_S21]


#### Tips and Strategies

* Break up UI recursively with panels that contain panels
* Cluster components into panels based on layout needs
* Provide a layout manager for each panel
* Consider making each panel into a view (see MVC lecture...)
    - reduces coupling between parts of program


#### Custom Layout Managers

* Sometimes, we want a more specific, non-standard layout that cannot be achieved by the default layout managers

```
public interface LayoutManager {
    void addLayoutComponent(String name, Component comp);
    void removeLayoutComponent(...)
    ... 
}
```

* We can build our own layout to achieve our desired effects


#### XML

* Many programming languages use XML to create UIs (Android esp.)
    - enables better separation of the appearance and application code
    - UI descriptions are external to your application code, which means that you can modify or adapt it without having to modify your source doe and recompile
    - declaring the layout in XML makes it easier to visualize the structure of your UI, so it's easier to debug problems
* Potential issues
    - Android context needs to be considered (config doesn't change(?))
    - Many XML-based layouts use absolute positioning, relative positioning, etc.
    - A lot of burder on programmer to maintain
