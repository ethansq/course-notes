### Affine Transformations in Java


#### Useful Graphics2D Methods

* AffineTransform `getTransform()`, `void setTransform(AffineTransform Tx)`
    - returns/sets a copy of the current Transform in the Graphics2D context
* `void rotate(double theta)`, `void rotate(double theta, double x, double y)`
    - concatenates the current Graphics@D transformation with a rotation transform
* `void scale(double sx, double sy)`
* `void translate(double tx, double ty)`

AffineTransform handles all matrix manipulations

* A bit more control than Graphics2D

__Static Methods__

* static AffineTransform getRotateInstance(double theta)
* static AffineTransform getRotateInstance(double theta, double anchorx, double anchory)
* static AffineTransform getScaleInstance(double sx, double sy)
* static AffineTransform getTranslateInstance(double tx, double ty)

__Concatenation Methods__

* void rotate(double theta), void rotate(double theta, double anchorx, double anchory)
* void scale(...)
* void translate(...)
* void concatenate(AffineTransform Tx)

__Other Methods__

* AffineTransform createInvers()
* void transform(Point2D[] ptSrc, int srcOff, ...)

__Slides worth noting__

* L17_S42; RotateTriangle.java
* ...



### Scene Graphs

* A mechanism for drawing a series of connected components
    - each part has a transform matrix
    - each part draws its children relative to itself
        + (torso)
            - head
            - right upper arm
                + right lower arm
                    * right hand
            - left upper arm
                + ...
            - right upper leg
                + ...
            - left upper leg
                + ...  
* An interactor tree is a type of scene graph
* Each component has an affine transformation matrix, and a paint routine
    - Matrix describes the components location relative to its parent
        + ie. what translations should be performed on it
        + The pain routine concatenates the parents affine transformation matrix with the components matrix and then paints using the resulting matrix
        + eg. M1: translate (10,10)
            * M2: translate (5,5)
                - this (5,5) is relative to M1
                - and, supposedly, M1 is relative to its parent as well

As we navigate the interactor tree, we combine successive matrices to reflect the way each component is positioned relative to its parent.

Each component should...

1. paint itself
    * using its affine transformation matrix
2. for each of its children
    * save current affine transformation
    * calculate a new transform matrix using the current (parent) transform matrix and the location of the child
        - eg. `curr * child_translation_transformation`
    * tell child to paint themselves using their new affine transform matrix
    * return the original affine transformation matrix



### Inside Tests

We also need to transform any coordinates in events as the events are passed down the interactor tree

* This allows us to translate between global and local (or relative) coordinate systems

For example, a mouse event in the window's coordinates will need its coordinates translated to a child component's local (relative) location prior to passing it down

* Affine transformations can be used for this, as well

Mouse and shape model must use the same coordinate system.
Either

* Transform mouse to model coordinates
    - suppose we zoomed in... our model coordinates are still the same, but when we click, the window coordinates are no longer in a 1:1 scale with the model's coordinates
        + if we click (2,2), it may be within a triangle in 2X zoom, but not in 1X zoom
        + to verify if the triangle was actually clicked... need to compare with original coordinates of the triangle
            * if we scale the triangle by 2X (to zoom), we need to 1/2 the mouse coordinates...
            * we need to apply the inverse transformation to the mouse coordinates
* or Transform model to mouse coordinates
    - alternatively, we can transform the triangle's coordinates (by a scale, perhaps), and check if the mouse click falls within it...
