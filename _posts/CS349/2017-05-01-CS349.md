User interface: place where a person expresses intention to an artifact, and the artifact presents feedback to the person.
> the term artifact can apply to any object, so things have hammers have "user interfaces" too...

Interactive System Architecture
> [user] expresses --> [artifact] translates --> [artifact] presents --> [user] perceives

Model-View-Controller (MVC)
> [user] expresses intention --> [artifact] translates in the Controller, changes data in the Model, and notifies the View to update and present new visuals --> [use] perceives
> example: graphical temperature control
	* [user] expresses intention (e.g. mouse movements, mouse events)
	* [artifact] Controller translates mouse events
	* [artifact] changes Model data ==> max=30, temp=18, min=10
	* [artifact] Model notifies View ==> draws widget with new data, and presents

Interface vs. Interaction
> Interface
--> external presentation to user
	* controls (what the user can manipulate/use to communicate an intent)
	* visual, physical, auditory (what program uses to communicate its response)
> Interaction
--> used to connote behaviour: user must invoke to perform a task and the corresponding responses
	* interaction is action and dialog(ue)
	* unfolds over time

Why is interaction design difficult?
> Variability in users and tasks
	* varying levels of expertise among users
	* often, a range of tasks will be performed using the same tool. How can we anticipate all the possible use cases and scenarios?
> No single "right way" to design an interface: can always be improved
> Pushing technology forward requires us to rethink interaction (innovate according to new expectations)

Why study interaction?
> Well-designed interfaces empower users to do things they couldn't otherwise do
	* movie production/editing, image editing, desktop publishing, ...
> Interaction is key to enabling new technologies
	* multi-touch and gestures
	* voice interfaces
	* touch screens for tablets/notebooks

This course will focus on the interaction and development of user-interfaces, not the user experience. User-centered design is covered in CS449
> how to design, implement, and evaluate user interfaces
	* provide foundational knowledge for building highly interactive, usable desktop, web, and mobile applications
	* illustrate underlying architecture of modern GUI toolkits
	* explore strategies applicable across a range of interface problems
	* explore essential design tools, techniques, and processes
> ways to understand users
	* the physical and cognitive abilities of users
	* visual design principles
