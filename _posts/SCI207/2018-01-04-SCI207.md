# 2.0 Life


## Evolution

Evolution is rather well-understood. It's a powerful idea—a cornerstone of modern science

* It explains things in a natural and (relatively) simple way
	- Radioactivity causes mutations
	- Can mathematically calculate rate(s) of mutations
		- Species gradually change in their environments. Better-adapted organisms move forwards
* Through mutations and adaptation, eukaryotes evolved/bifurcated into various species
* However, this means we're not really interested


## Origin

* When, where, and how did life begin?


### When


##### Living Stromatolites

* Layers of sediment intermixed with different types of microbes
* "Autotrophs" (photosynthesizing cyanobacteria "phototrophs") near the top of the layer produce organic compounds
	- They breathe, consume water, etc., to create energy/generate metabolism
* "Heterotrophs" beneath consume organic "waste," in a cycle that represents a microcosm of life on Earth today
	- Much of life on Earth has a symbiotic relationship with each other
* ...


##### Fossilized Stromatolites

* Similarity of layering structure suggests similar origin
* But is the layering biological or geological in origin?
	- Is it produced by a geological process, or life?
	- eg. Mars
		- Methane gas produced/appears seasonally. Is this an evidence of life? Lots of life on Earth produce methane
		- Question, is this methane a result of a geophysical process, or actual life?
* Wide variety of structures & isotopic analysis favour a biological origin
	- Carbon sometimes comes in a variety with an extra neutron and 7 electrons
		- Stars make carbon-12 and carbon-13. In nature, this can be predicted using nuclear physics.
		- Normal ratio of C-12 to C-13 is 89:1
	- However, life metabolized C-12 slightly more readily than C-13
		- **A C-12/C-13 ratio higher than 89:1 indicates "organic carbon" ==> life**

**So what?**

* Fossilized stromatolites date back to 3.5 billion years ago
* Photosynthesis is a very complex metabolic process
	- No way original life could be capable of photosynthesis
		- Origin of life must/should substantially predate this


##### Microfossils

* Would be nice to find individual fossilized cells

**Challenges**

* Need old rocks not changed by geologicl processes
	- Lots of recycling of rock
		- Tectonic plates, volcanic activity, etc.
	- Also, question: is the structure biological or mineral in origin?
* Oldest microfossil (3.4 BYA)?
	- Evidence
		* Biological-like behaviour: clustering & habitat
		* High C-12/C-13 ratio in apparent cell wall
		* Different isotope of sulfur inside and around the cell wall
			- Suggests it was metabolising sulfur for energy


##### Oldest Isotopic Evidence?

* Higher C12/C-13 ratio is found in 3.85 BYA rock on the island of Akilia
	* Unfortunately, this is _metamorphic_ rock
		* ie. rock transformed by high heat and pressure, which destroys microfossils
* Evidence supported by...
	* Similar evidence elsewhere
	* Bio-altering isotopic ratios of other elements like iron, nitrogen, and sulfur
* Relatively complex life was widespread on Earth at least 3.5 BYA (stromatolites), and possibly as far back as 3.85 BYA
	* [Maybe even 4.1 BYA](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/47/14518.full.pdf)
	* So what?
		* This means life arose considerably earlier than 3.85 BYA
			* ie. quite early in Earth's history, as soon as conditions allowed, after the 'late heavy bombardment'
			* If life arose through a simple natural process (as opposed to a lucky event), then life might be quite common in the universe.
		* Of course, the exact date of when life began is still a mystery...


### Where


##### Genetic Evidence

* Evolution works slowly
	* By **mutation** (random)
	* By **natural selection** (non-random)
* Starting with the DNA of the Last Universal Common Ancestor of all life today, mutations slowly accumulate as species differentiate and bifurcate
* Earth is constantly bombarded by high-energy particles, which potentially leads to mutations
	* Mutations are steady, and rates of mutation can be computed
* Comparisons amongst the DNA of species alive today allows biologists to map evolutionary history
	* Two species with very similar DNA ==> more recent divergence
	* Two species with very different DNA ==> more ancient divergence
* eg. plants and animals are actually quite similar (recently diverged)
* Just as sharks branched off earlier than primates (as geological/fossil records confirm), some modern microbes are more closely related to the earliest organisms than others
* Unfortunately, evidence regarding the nature of the organisms near the root of the tree is still not clear
	* Initially, they were thought to be extremophiles, like those living today near deep-sea hydrothermal vents, or deep underground
	* Recently, evidence emerged for non-extremophiles, like certain living archaea


##### Geological Evidence

* Without exception, every life-form on Earth requires water. As such, **it's unlikely that life originated on land**
	* Moreover, early atmosphere had no oxygen (O2), no ozone (O3)
		* No protection from the Sun's intense UV
		* Life itself produces the atmosphere's oxygen
* Darwin's Little Ponds?
	* Organic compounds can form spontaneously
	* The moon used to be a lot closer, hence higher tides
	* Tides, along with wetting/evaporation, would increase the concentration of these organic compounds
	* Perhaps volcanic hot springs offered the energy to support an origin of life?
	* Problem
		* Not much protection from UV
* Deep-sea vents or underground
	* Provides protection from the Sun's UV
	* Plenty of chemical energy to fuel reactions that may have led to life
		* for underground hypothesis: reactions between water & minerals in rock
	* Even if life arose in Darwin's Ponds, lunar evidence of asteroid/comet impacts of the 'late heavy bombardment' suggests life would probably have been destroyed if it didn't migrate into the deep-sea


### How?


##### Life is very complex chemistry, and more

**Amino acids** are the building blocks of life

* More than 100 amino acids occur in bacteria and plants, but only about 20 are commonly found in animals
* 12 can be synthesized by the human body
	* The remaining 8 must come from our diet, the _essential_ amino acids
* Amino acids make up proteins, the second-largest component of human muscles, cells, and other tissues
	* Water is the largest

**Proteins are long chains of animo acids**, folded up in a complicated 3D structure, both of which determine the protein's function

* Catalyzing metabolic reactions (enzymes)
* DNA recplication
	* Very complex process, and proteins help
	* More than a dozen enzymes are involved in unzipping the DNA, checking an correcting errors, and re-zipping the duplicated DNA
* Transporting molecules around

Typical example of an enzyme (hexokinase), involved in catalyzing the conversion of glucose to glucose 6-phosphate via ATP

* Basically the same molecule, with some phosphate attached
* Hexokinase enzymes have little pockets, which helps connect molecules together


##### Initial puzzles


* At the very least, life requires
	* Amino acids
		* Where do these come from?
	* Time
		* For interesting things to happen
* Then, we can start to think about how simple organic compounds gave rise, over time, to complex and replicating life
	* Having notes is not the same as having music


##### Early Earth

Age of the Earth & Concept of "Deep Time"

* Theology
	* A few thousand years to infinite, or cyclical
	* Commonly 5000-10000 years
	* Our thinking is limit to thousands of years, with age(s) of empires, cities, generations, etc
* Starting in 1700s, **rock erosion, sedimentation, and salt in the oceans** suggest 10-100 million
	* How long would it take for natural wind and water erosion to carve a canyon?
	* Sediments in the ocean that have risen up (like the Cliffs of Dover)
		* What's the sedimentation rate per year? Based on such, must be more than "thousands" of years
* 1856, Helmholtz: Assumed that the Sun's energy came from **gravitational collapse**
	* Suggests 22 million years, but is too small because it ignored the Sun's real energy source: fusion
* 1862, Lord Kelvin
	* **Cooling of initially molten Earth** --> 20-400 million
	* Still too small, as it ignored heating due to radioactivity of the rocks
		* Which will generally keep the rocks heated for longer
* By later 1800s, geologists & evolutionists aruged for much (much) older --> billions --> bitter disputes
	* Preface in the first version of On Origin of Species was removed by Lord Kelvin
* 1904, Ernest Rutherford
	* Realized **radioactivity** could heat the Earth
	* ie. Age could be much greater than Kelvin's 1897 revised estimate of 20 million
	* Took first step towards **radiometric dating** of the Earth
* 1924, Arthur Holmes
	* The _Age of the Earth, and Introduction of Geological Ideas_ suggests/finds 1.6-3.0 billion years


##### Early Earth

* Today, we know Earth is 4.54 +- 0.05 BYO
* **Radiometric dating** (eg. Potassium-40 and Argon-40) of **meteorites** left over from Solar System formation --> 4.567 BYO
* ...consistent with radiometric dating of oldest Earth rocks (zircon crystals in Australia) --> 4.404 BYO
* ...consistent with radiometric dating of the oldest Apollo Moon rocks
* ...consistent with comparing the mass and luminosity of the Sun to those of **other stars**
	* Stars gradually brighten
* The Sun formed from the gravitational collapse of a small part of a giant molecular cloud (H + He + heavier elements aka. "dust", ie. "stardust");
	* The Earth formed in a few million years by electrostatic then gravitational accretion of dust into grains --> clumps of grains --> planetesimals (~10 KM) --> high gravitation pull --> absorbs debris into a planet sized ball

Initially, the Earth had no oceans or atmosphere

* Made from rocky/metallic planetesimals (icy planetesimals formed further out from the Sun)
* Too small & warm to hold onto Hydrogen or Helium gasses, and too little other gasses around

Current models _suggest_

* Rocky/icy plenetsimals far from Sun later flung inward by gravitation encounters
* Trapped water and gas in this rock was later outgassed by volcanos (when Earth cooled)
	* **Water vapor condensed to form oceans**
	* **Gasses (main CO2; also N2, H2S, SO2, H2) formed early atmosphere**

Zircon evidence suggests Earth possibly had continents, oceans, and atmopshere as soon as 100 million years after the planet first formed

* U-Pb dating --> solid zircon 4.4 BYA
* Oxygen isotopes --> solidified in presence of water
* Radioactive rocks, or impact that made Moon --> Accelerated heating --> Outgassing?
* **Note: Life arose in a nearly oxygen-free environment**
	* O2 is highly reactive
		* Prevents complex organic molecules forming outside cells
	* **Life as we known it could not form in the present environment on Earth**
		* Oxygen is too volatile: it oxydizes(?), etc
	* Oxygen only came after photo-synthesis and other life-forms began synthesizing it


##### Origin of Organic Molecules

Famous Miller-Urey experiment

* Assumed (wrongly) that early Earth atmosphere was methane and ammonia, and energy driving chemical reations was lightning
* **Readily synthesized amino acids and other organic molecules**
	* Amino acids can be easily created
* Similar experiments today...
	* Problem: don' know exact composition of the early atmosphere, especially H2 content

Other sources

* Chemical reactions between water and minerals near deep-sea vents
* Material from space
	* Asteroids & comets, UV from Sun acting on dust in solar nebula


##### Chemistry --> Biology?

Nobody thinks organic molecules just "popped up"

* Plenty of organic molecules around, but how do they form living/replicating cells?
* Random chance is virtually impossible
	* There must be a _natural mechanism_, but what?
* Looking for high probability "chemical pathways"...


##### Chicken & Egg Paradox 1

Ribonucleic Acid (RNA, single-helix)
Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA, double-helix)

Modern DNA cannot replicate without catalysing proteins, and enzymes cannot be made without DNA.

* Which came first?
	* Possible solution: 1980s (Thomas Cech and colleagues—Nobel prize 1989)
	* RNA itself can catalyse many cellular biochemical reactions including (partially) _their own replication_
	* This supports the idea of an earlier "RNA World", where RNA serves as both genetic and catalysing molecule


##### RNA World

Experiment

* Inorganic minerals (a kind of "clay") can facilitate self-assembly of RNA strands
* Quickly and easily produces RNA stranges up to a few dozen bases in length
	* Note, zircon grain analysis suggests "clay" was widespread 4.4 BYA)
	* These RNA bases adhere to "clay" and essentially combine
* However, need length > 165 bases for RNA to be able to catalyse its own replication
* Short strands easily peel away from the clay & fold in ways that promote joining
* Strands as small as 5 bases are able to catalyse various chemical reactions... like joining short strands into longer strands
* Given the countless clay grinds, and that the RNA enzyme for joining is very simple, it is not unreasonable to expect very long RNA strands to form naturally (spontaneously)
* This natural mechanism for creating longer RNA strands would have dramatically increased the chance of getting an RNA molecule long enough to self-replicate
	* Once this happens, growth is exponential


##### Chicken & Egg Paradox 2

Which came first, the cell membrane or its contents (genes and proteins)?

* Sciences have known for decades that cooling a warm-water solution of amino acids can cause them to bond, forming a spherical shell **"pre-cell"**. Lipids (fats) in water also form pre-cells on the surface of the same clay minrals that assemble RNA molecules
	* Some pre-cell membrances exhibit real cell-membrance behaviours, like
		* Selective molecule transport across the membrane
		* Electrostatic energy storage and discharge
		* Growth and splitting into "daughter" spheres
