# 2.0 Life


## Evolution

Evolution is rather well-understood. It's a powerful idea—a cornerstone of modern science

* It explains things in a natural and (relatively) simple way
	- Radioactivity causes mutations
	- Can mathematically calculate rate(s) of mutations
		- Species gradually change in their environments. Better-adapted organisms move forwards
* Through mutations and adaptation, eukaryotes evolved/bifurcated into various species
* However, this means we're not really interested


## Origin

* When, where, and how did life begin?


### When


##### Living Stromatolites

* Layers of sediment intermixed with different types of microbes
* "Autotrophs" (photosynthesizing cyanobacteria "phototrophs") near the top of the layer produce organic compounds
	- They breathe, consume water, etc., to create energy/generate metabolism
* "Heterotrophs" beneath consume organic "waste," in a cycle that represents a microcosm of life on Earth today
	- Much of life on Earth has a symbiotic relationship with each other
* ...


##### Fossilized Stromatolites

* Similarity of layering structure suggests similar origin
* But is the layering biological or geological in origin?
	- Is it produced by a geological process, or life?
	- eg. Mars
		- Methane gas produced/appears seasonally. Is this an evidence of life? Lots of life on Earth produce methane
		- Question, is this methane a result of a geophysical process, or actual life?
* Wide variety of structures & isotopic analysis favour a biological origin
	- Carbon sometimes comes in a variety with an extra neutron and 7 electrons
		- Stars make carbon-12 and carbon-13. In nature, this can be predicted using nuclear physics.
		- Normal ratio of C-12 to C-13 is 89:1
	- However, life metabolized C-12 slightly more readily than C-13
		- **A C-12/C-13 ratio higher than 89:1 indicates "organic carbon" ==> life**

**So what?**

* Fossilized stromatolites date back to 3.5 billion years ago
* Photosynthesis is a very complex metabolic process
	- No way original life could be capable of photosynthesis
		- Origin of life must/should substantially predate this


##### Microfossils

* Would be nice to find individual fossilized cells

**Challenges**

* Need old rocks not changed by geologicl processes
	- Lots of recycling of rock
		- Tectonic plates, volcanic activity, etc.
	- Also, question: is the structure biological or mineral in origin?
* Oldest microfossil (3.4 BYA)?
	- Evidence
		* Biological-like behaviour: clustering & habitat
		* High C-12/C-13 ratio in apparent cell wall
		* Different isotope of sulfur inside and around the cell wall
			- Suggests it was metabolising sulfur for energy


##### Oldest Isotopic Evidence?

* Higher C12/C-13 ratio is found in 3.85 BYA rock on the island of Akilia
	* Unfortunately, this is _metamorphic_ rock
		* ie. rock transformed by high heat and pressure, which destroys microfossils
* Evidence supported by...
	* Similar evidence elsewhere
	* Bio-altering isotopic ratios of other elements like iron, nitrogen, and sulfur
* Relatively complex life was widespread on Earth at least 3.5 BYA (stromatolites), and possibly as far back as 3.85 BYA
	* [Maybe even 4.1 BYA](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/47/14518.full.pdf)
	* So what?
		* This means life arose considerably earlier than 3.85 BYA
			* ie. quite early in Earth's history, as soon as conditions allowed, after the 'late heavy bombardment'
			* If life arose through a simple natural process (as opposed to a lucky event), then life might be quite common in the universe.
		* Of course, the exact date of when life began is still a mystery...


### Where


##### Genetic Evidence

* Evolution works slowly
	* By **mutation** (random)
	* By **natural selection** (non-random)
* Starting with the DNA of the Last Universal Common Ancestor of all life today, mutations slowly accumulate as species differentiate and bifurcate
* Earth is constantly bombarded by high-energy particles, which potentially leads to mutations
	* Mutations are steady, and rates of mutation can be computed
* Comparisons amongst the DNA of species alive today allows biologists to map evolutionary history
	* Two species with very similar DNA ==> more recent divergence
	* Two species with very different DNA ==> more ancient divergence
* eg. plants and animals are actually quite similar (recently diverged)
* Just as sharks branched off earlier than primates (as geological/fossil records confirm), some modern microbes are more closely related to the earliest organisms than others
* Unfortunately, evidence regarding the nature of the organisms near the root of the tree is still not clear
	* Initially, they were thought to be extremophiles, like those living today near deep-sea hydrothermal vents, or deep underground
	* Recently, evidence emerged for non-extremophiles, like certain living archaea


##### Geological Evidence

* Without exception, every life-form on Earth requires water. As such, **it's unlikely that life originated on land**
	* Moreover, early atmosphere had no oxygen (O2), no ozone (O3)
		* No protection from the Sun's intense UV
		* Life itself produces the atmosphere's oxygen
* Darwin's Little Ponds?
	* Organic compounds can form spontaneously
	* The moon used to be a lot closer, hence higher tides
	* Tides, along with wetting/evaporation, would increase the concentration of these organic compounds
	* Perhaps volcanic hot springs offered the energy to support an origin of life?
	* Problem
		* Not much protection from UV
* Deep-sea vents or underground
	* Provides protection from the Sun's UV
	* Plenty of chemical energy to fuel reactions that may have led to life
		* for underground hypothesis: reactions between water & minerals in rock
	* Even if life arose in Darwin's Ponds, lunar evidence of asteroid/comet impacts of the 'late heavy bombardment' suggests life would probably have been destroyed if it didn't migrate into the deep-sea


### How?


##### Life is very complex chemistry, and more

**Amino acids** are the building blocks of life

* More than 100 amino acids occur in bacteria and plants, but only about 20 are commonly found in animals
* 12 can be synthesized by the human body
	* The remaining 8 must come from our diet, the _essential_ amino acids
* Amino acids make up proteins, the second-largest component of human muscles, cells, and other tissues
	* Water is the largest

**Proteins are long chains of animo acids**, folded up in a complicated 3D structure, both of which determine the protein's function

* Catalyzing metabolic reactions (enzymes)
* DNA recplication
	* Very complex process, and proteins help
	* More than a dozen enzymes are involved in unzipping the DNA, checking an correcting errors, and re-zipping the duplicated DNA
* Transporting molecules around

Typical example of an enzyme (hexokinase), involved in catalyzing the conversion of glucose to glucose 6-phosphate via ATP

* Basically the same molecule, with some phosphate attached
* Hexokinase enzymes have little pockets, which helps connect molecules together


##### Initial puzzles


* At the very least, life requires
	* Amino acids
		* Where do these come from?
	* Time
		* For interesting things to happen
* Then, we can start to think about how simple organic compounds gave rise, over time, to complex and replicating life
	* Having notes is not the same as having music


##### Early Earth

Age of the Earth & Concept of "Deep Time"

* Theology
	* A few thousand years to infinite, or cyclical
	* Commonly 5000-10000 years
	* Our thinking is limit to thousands of years, with age(s) of empires, cities, generations, etc
* Starting in 1700s, **rock erosion, sedimentation, and salt in the oceans** suggest 10-100 million
	* How long would it take for natural wind and water erosion to carve a canyon?
	* Sediments in the ocean that have risen up (like the Cliffs of Dover)
		* What's the sedimentation rate per year? Based on such, must be more than "thousands" of years
* 1856, Helmholtz: Assumed that the Sun's energy came from **gravitational collapse**
	* Suggests 22 million years, but is too small because it ignored the Sun's real energy source: fusion
* 1862, Lord Kelvin
	* **Cooling of initially molten Earth** --> 20-400 million
	* Still too small, as it ignored heating due to radioactivity of the rocks
		* Which will generally keep the rocks heated for longer
* By later 1800s, geologists & evolutionists aruged for much (much) older --> billions --> bitter disputes
	* Preface in the first version of On Origin of Species was removed by Lord Kelvin
* 1904, Ernest Rutherford
	* Realized **radioactivity** could heat the Earth
	* ie. Age could be much greater than Kelvin's 1897 revised estimate of 20 million
	* Took first step towards **radiometric dating** of the Earth
* 1924, Arthur Holmes
	* The _Age of the Earth, and Introduction of Geological Ideas_ suggests/finds 1.6-3.0 billion years


##### Early Earth

* Today, we know Earth is 4.54 +- 0.05 BYO
* **Radiometric dating** (eg. Potassium-40 and Argon-40) of **meteorites** left over from Solar System formation --> 4.567 BYO
* ...consistent with radiometric dating of oldest Earth rocks (zircon crystals in Australia) --> 4.404 BYO
* ...consistent with radiometric dating of the oldest Apollo Moon rocks
* ...consistent with comparing the mass and luminosity of the Sun to those of **other stars**
	* Stars gradually brighten
* The Sun formed from the gravitational collapse of a small part of a giant molecular cloud (H + He + heavier elements aka. "dust", ie. "stardust");
	* The Earth formed in a few million years by electrostatic then gravitational accretion of dust into grains --> clumps of grains --> planetesimals (~10 KM) --> high gravitation pull --> absorbs debris into a planet sized ball

Initially, the Earth had no oceans or atmosphere

* Made from rocky/metallic planetesimals (icy planetesimals formed further out from the Sun)
* Too small & warm to hold onto Hydrogen or Helium gasses, and too little other gasses around

Current models _suggest_

* Rocky/icy plenetsimals far from Sun later flung inward by gravitation encounters
* Trapped water and gas in this rock was later outgassed by volcanos (when Earth cooled)
	* **Water vapor condensed to form oceans**
	* **Gasses (main CO2; also N2, H2S, SO2, H2) formed early atmosphere**

Zircon evidence suggests Earth possibly had continents, oceans, and atmopshere as soon as 100 million years after the planet first formed

* U-Pb dating --> solid zircon 4.4 BYA
* Oxygen isotopes --> solidified in presence of water
* Radioactive rocks, or impact that made Moon --> Accelerated heating --> Outgassing?
* **Note: Life arose in a nearly oxygen-free environment**
	* O2 is highly reactive
		* Prevents complex organic molecules forming outside cells
	* **Life as we known it could not form in the present environment on Earth**
		* Oxygen is too volatile: it oxydizes(?), etc
	* Oxygen only came after photo-synthesis and other life-forms began synthesizing it


##### Origin of Organic Molecules

Famous Miller-Urey experiment

* Assumed (wrongly) that early Earth atmosphere was methane and ammonia, and energy driving chemical reations was lightning
* **Readily synthesized amino acids and other organic molecules**
	* Amino acids can be easily created
* Similar experiments today...
	* Problem: don' know exact composition of the early atmosphere, especially H2 content

Other sources

* Chemical reactions between water and minerals near deep-sea vents
* Material from space
	* Asteroids & comets, UV from Sun acting on dust in solar nebula


##### Chemistry --> Biology?

Nobody thinks organic molecules just "popped up"

* Plenty of organic molecules around, but how do they form living/replicating cells?
* Random chance is virtually impossible
	* There must be a _natural mechanism_, but what?
* Looking for high probability "chemical pathways"...


##### Chicken & Egg Paradox 1

Ribonucleic Acid (RNA, single-helix)
Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA, double-helix)

Modern DNA cannot replicate without catalysing proteins, and enzymes cannot be made without DNA.

* Which came first?
	* Possible solution: 1980s (Thomas Cech and colleagues—Nobel prize 1989)
	* RNA itself can catalyse many cellular biochemical reactions including (partially) _their own replication_
	* This supports the idea of an earlier "RNA World", where RNA serves as both genetic and catalysing molecule


##### RNA World

Experiment

* Inorganic minerals (a kind of "clay") can facilitate self-assembly of RNA strands
* Quickly and easily produces RNA stranges up to a few dozen bases in length
	* Note, zircon grain analysis suggests "clay" was widespread 4.4 BYA)
	* These RNA bases adhere to "clay" and essentially combine
* However, need length > 165 bases for RNA to be able to catalyse its own replication
* Short strands easily peel away from the clay & fold in ways that promote joining
* Strands as small as 5 bases are able to catalyse various chemical reactions... like joining short strands into longer strands
* Given the countless clay grinds, and that the RNA enzyme for joining is very simple, it is not unreasonable to expect very long RNA strands to form naturally (spontaneously)
* This natural mechanism for creating longer RNA strands would have dramatically increased the chance of getting an RNA molecule long enough to self-replicate
	* Once this happens, growth is exponential


##### Chicken & Egg Paradox 2

Which came first, the cell membrane or its contents (genes and proteins)?

* Sciences have known for decades that cooling a warm-water solution of amino acids can cause them to bond, forming a spherical shell **"pre-cell"**. Lipids (fats) in water also form pre-cells on the surface of the same clay minrals that assemble RNA molecules
	* Some pre-cell membrances exhibit real cell-membrance behaviours, like
		* Selective molecule transport across the membrane
		* Electrostatic energy storage and discharge
		* Growth and splitting into "daughter" spheres
* [Slide 34]


##### RNA World --> DNA World

Gradually, these **RNA organisms** would have become "alive," or "biological", in the sense we think of now

* Biological natural selection could then take over, resulting eventually in a DNA World
	* Similarity between RNA & DNA
	* DNA is more durable as a hereditary material
	* DNA is less prone to copying errors
* RNA also served other functions in the cell, and so would stay, with now DNA serving the hereditary role

...


##### Summary

We still don't know how life started, and probably will never know

* [Research continues (TODO FIX LINK)](...)
	* ```...a pair of simple compounds (HCN—Hydrogen Cyanid & H2S—Hydrogen Sulfide), which would have been abundant on early Earth, can give rise to a network of simple reactions that produce the three major classes of biomolecules—nucleic acids, amino acids, and lipids.```
		* If true, it might solve **both** chicken/egg paradoxes
* We have constructed one **plausible** model (RNA World), backed up at many points by experiments, and scientists are working on others


##### Main Point

The origin of life seems like a **plausible/likely** consequence of conditions on early Earth and the laws of nature

* Chemistry --> Biology
* It wasn't luck. It was probably bound to happen eventually
* But is life a **necessary** consequence of the laws of nature at the most elementary level, ie. physics?


## Life - Physics (Energy)

Living organisms must eat to sustain themselves. Why?

* Something to do with "we are what we eat"
	* We get building blocks like amino acids
* Also, for calories: we get **energy**
* Energy in always equals energy out, although in different methods
	* How does that energy go through our system?
		* We take **high-ordered** energy, and release **low-order** energy

In exploring the origin of life, it helps to better understand **what life is.**

* We will see that energy (the flow of energy and dispersion) is central to this understanding
* First, the concept of **energy** and the **principle of conservation** of energy are central to all of science, and so worthwhile to explore


### Potential Energy

* When a ball collides _elastically_ with a wall, it momentarily comes to rest, and so has no kinetic energy
* However, its shape is distorted like compressed spring
	* It "springs back" to its original shape and restores the ball's original kinetic energy
	* As it's compressed/compressing, its kinetic energy is low
		* An object consists of more than simple kinetic energy
		* In this case, the original kinetic energy is converted or stored in another form/somewhere else
* Atoms are made of electrically charged particles
	* A pos-charged nucleus and neg-charged electrons
	* Each charged particle is surrounded by an electric field, **E**
* The electric fields of two or more charged particles _add_ to produce a _net_ electric field in the space around the particles


#### An electric field

* Stores energy in the space between charged particles, with **energy density =** `(1/2) * |E|^2` (joules per cubic metre)
* ...

The **electric field energy** stored between two metal plates.

* This can be converted into kinetic energy (in this case, a 3.2 kg projectile moving at Mach 7)
	* This is a rail gun
* This may also spark the release of more energy (via nuclear fusion) through the **Z-pinch effect**
	* Z-Machine at Sandia National Labs
	* Parallel charged wires will attract each other, and "pinch" at a point
		* There's material inside the "tube" of wires, and the compression force is enough to cause nuclear fusion (?)

Energy can also be stored in a **magnetic field, B**, with **energy density =** `(1/2) * |B|^2`

* As the sun rotates, it twists its magnetic field, which can snap and cause solar flares
	* A solar flare converts magnetic field energy into kinetic energy (up to `~10^25 J`) or billions of the most powerful nuclear bombs human have built
	* Planets with liquid space need to be in "close" vicinity to red dwarves, which leaves it vulnerable to death-by-flare


#### Light is an electromagnetic field

* Faraday
	* A changing magnetic field creates an electric field
* Maxwell
	* A changing electric field creates a magnetic field

These two mechanisms work together to create light

* A mutually self-sustaining, changing pattern of electric and magnetic fields in space
* Light is potential energy stored in electric and magnetic fields, being transported through a vacuum at 300,000,0000 m/s


#### Gravitational Potential Energy

Tremendous amount of gravitational potential energy when an object is far away.

* As the object moves closes, kinetic energy accumulates and the object becomes faster, while gravitation potential energy decreases
* This provided the spark that ignited the Sun's thermonuclear fusion reactions, which now provide virtually all energy for life on Earth


#### Thermal Energy

When a ball bounces elastically, the energy converts back and forth between kinetic and potential (gravitational & electric field) energy

* Total energy is being conserved, but total kinetic energy becomes less and less
* When the ball is inelastic, it seems as if the energy is disappearing
	* It's not disappearing, it's just that the kinetic energy is being converted into another form
* What does the collision on the ground do to the kinetic energy in the ball?
	* Initially, all the particles in the ball are moving in the same direction (a bunch of arrows pointing in the same direction)
		* We say their KE is coherent and ordered
	* Collisions, however, randomize the kinetic energy (arrows now point in random directions)
	* With each collision, these atoms are given energy but they go in random directions
		* Each collision increases the disordered KE in the ball
		* And decreased the ordered KE in the ball
			* **Kinetic energy is still the same**
		* If the arrows could magically be rearranged to point in the same direction, it would start moving that way
	* Finally, the particles in the ball have no more ordered KE (the ball, as a whole, has no motion)
		* The particles in the ground near the ball have acquired more disordered KE
* The Industrial Revolution is based on our ability to rearrange these arrows somehow
	* Not directly, but "generating" ordered kinetic energy was key


More correctly, thermal energy is the total energy associated with the thermal motion of a system of particles, including both kinetic and potential (field) energies

* In the case of gases, the potential (field) energies are negligible, and the thermal energy is in the form of the disordered kinetic energy of the gas particles

Humans eat ordered energy and release disordered energy in equal quantity.


### Einstein on Energy

`E = mc^2`

* Energy is equivalent to mass
	* We're not sure what either is, but at least the mysteries were reduced from 2 to 1
* Objects resist change in motion
	* The more "massive," the more resistant it is to change in motion
	* **Mass** is the resistance of an object to changes in its motion
		* As such, another name for _mass_ is _inertia_

**All forms of energy have mass (or inertia; resistance to acceleration)**


#### Kinetic energy has mass

Heating the gas in a box (adding KE) makes it harder to accelerate the box
	* The box now has more mass, although we didn't "add" any new particles
	* How much energy did we add with the flame?
	* `deltaMass = deltaEnergy / c^2`
		* This number is exceedingly small, virtually unrecognizable, because c is so large


#### Potential energy has mass

Compressed springs weigh more. Not much more, but it has been measured


#### Thermal energy has mass

A hot cup of cofee (more kinetic and potential energy) is harder to get moving

* It will weigh more on a **very** precise scale
* Not noticeable to humans


#### Electromagnetic energy has mass

* A mirror box full of light is harder to accelerate than the same box but empty
* Even something like light adds mass


### What does E=mc^2 mean?

Turning it around... then `m=E/c^2`

* Mass itself has energy
* An electon and positron (electron's anti-matter cousin) both have the same "rest mass."
	* They can annihilate each other, leaving an equivalent amount of mass-energy in the form of light
	* The total mass does not change. The total energy does not change
		* Mass is not converted into energy, nor vice versa
		* It's just 20th century alchemy
			* One type of matter (electrons) is converted into another (photons)
* Conversation of energy and conservation of mass are the same law
	* Because energy and mass are equivalent

...


### Life is profoudly physical

...


## Life - Physics (Entrophy)


#### Brownian Motion

* Lucretius (c. 60 BC), _On the Nature of Things_: used the random motion of dust motes in a shaft of sunlight as evidence for Democritus' idea of atoms
	- Essentially correct
* Named after the botanist Robert Brown who, in 1827, observed similar random motion of pollen grains in water
	- Suggests the existence of atoms and molecules, which "push" these grains and dust motes around, producing their seemingly random motion
* Mathematical descriptions began in the late 1800s
	- Einstein (1905) made a detailed quantitative analysis of Brownian motion that provided definitive confirmation that atoms and molecules actually exist


#### Diffusion

The net migration of particles from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration

* This is the process that animates life
* Diffusion is similar to Brownian motion
	- Each particle moves independently, ...
* ...
* Continues until there is an equal concentration of particles in all layers --> equal number randomly moving right or left through any area A
* **Dynamic equilibrium**
	- ...

Nature has no inherent preference for one state ove another. There are simply many more ways for the particles to be spread out than they are to be localized

* Even a tiny amount of spreading opens a vast increase in number of nearby states like this, compared to the less spread out state it come from
* The system **could** go back, but by the **law of large numbers**, it will spend virtually all of its time "lost" in the huge new space nearby, more spread out states
* This continues until **equilibrium**
	- There are stupendously more uniform-like states than even the slightly less uniform-like states a moment before
	- The system **inexorably ratchets** towards equilibrum
		* Every step it takes to becoming more spread out, it can still go back, but there are so few states that are more concentrated and so many states that are less concentrated
* Again, there's no reason the system can't go back to its original state
	- It's merely extremely unlikely
	- Basically, this process is irreversible

**There are no physical laws that govern this process.** It is driven one way (and not the other) by purely random, purposeless thermal motion.

* Of all possible next states (of which nature prefers none), the vast majority are more spread out, so chances are the next state will be of a more spread out variation
* Same for a coffee cup. There are stupendously more ways for thermal energy to spread uniformly throughout the room than to spread throughout the coffee alone
* There is nothing preventing the thermal energy from flowing from the warmed air back into the room-temperature coffee
	- It's just too unlikely


#### Second Law of Thermodynamics

**The entropy of an isolated system never decreases

* The most potent statement in all of science
* Roughly speaking, **entropy** is a measure of **disorder**. The natural diffusion or dispersion of energy (or particles) increases disorder in the universe
	- This happens naturally and spontaneously
	- But, this occurs at the expense of **greater increase** in disorder elsewhere
	- So, the universe as a whole (or any isolated system in the universe) inexorably **ratchts towards greater disorder**, or higher entropy
* While energy is conserved, it is continually being **degraded** into lower quality energy.
	- Recall heat death
	- Still, it is precisely this lawless, purposeless process that is responsible for virtuall all change in the world
	- It is the **engine of life itself**


#### Entropy

First understood in the context of flow of thermal energy from a hot object to a cold object

Q = amount of thermal energy transferred
Let S denote the entropy in the system

```
deltaS = Sf - Si = Q / T

deltaS_hot = -Q / T_hot < 0 --> entroy of hot object decreases
deltaS_cold = Q / T_cold > 0 --> entropy of cold object increases

Consider deltaS = deltaS_hot + deltaS_cold
then,
T_hot > T_cold ==> deltaS > 0
```

* Entropy of cold object increases more than entropy of hot object decreases
	- Thus, we have a net increase

...

Kind of suggests that life is locked out of the past. Things happen towards higher entropy due to the overwhelmingly high odds of it happening. Conversely, things don't do "backwards" because it's far too unlikely.

However, there are **other ways entropy can increase**

* When particles disperse, entropy also increases
	- There are stupendously more ways for particles to uniformly fill a volume than to occupy one corner
		+ `S = k * logW` applies here also
* When structural order decreases, entropy also increases
	- Converly, when structure order increases, entropy decreases
	- There are stupendously more ways for particles to be structurally disordered than ordered
		+ `S = k * logW` applies here too
			* How many ways can water molecules be distributed in a waterdrop and still look like water?
				- Increased entropy
			* How about ice? Solids have more strict structures, and thus fewer possible structures
				- Reduced entropy


##### Summary

Boltzmann's formula `S = k * logW` quantitatively enumerates disorder in **all** of its forms

* The universality of this connection between macroscopic and microscopic worlds is why this formula is so important and far-reaching
* ...


#### Life and the Second Law

* Living organisms exhibit a very high degree of **order** or **complexity**
	- How do they maintain this order against the tendency towards universal decay into disorder?
		+ Does life not violate the Second Law?
	- What about evolution (to organisms of ever higher order or complexity)?
		+ Surely this violates the Second Law?
			* **No**: The universal ratcheting...


##### Example

A freezer can convert water at 0C to ice at 0C

* Ice is a more ordered structure than water, so changing water to ice reduces the entropy of the H2O
* The water-to-ice transition releases energy ("latent heat") because H2O bonds in ice are more stable (**stronger/lower energy**) than H2O bonds in water
	- The freezer removes this energy and dumps it into the environment
	- The resulting entropy increase (energy spreading) exceeds the water-to-ice decrease
		+ Hence, net entropy is positive (increase)
* A freezer does not violate the Second Law
* High quality energy in the form of electricity come into the freezer
* The food/contents of the freezer "consume" the energy, converting it into low quality (high entropy) energy


##### Order from Disorder

Recall the natural flow from order to disorder. While a ball falls, it has kinetic energy. It is very ordered: all of the particles have motion in the same direction (high degree of order)

* After a few bounces, the order has become disorderd. Motion in particles are now in different directions

**Question**

Can we build a machine that re-orders the energy?

* Of course, consider a car engine (a piston engine).
* Consider a simple gasoline engine
	- We have a cylinder, with a hot source at the top and a cold sink at the bottom
		+ Naturally, thermal energy spontaenously flows from the source to the sink
		+ But, this isn't too useful
	- What if we put some machine between the natural flow?

```
~~~~~~~
|HHHHH|
|     |
| v ~~~~~~~~
| v |		-->
| v ~~~~~~~~
|     |
|CCCCC|
~~~~~~~
```

* As gas is heated near the source, thermal energy moves towards the sink
* As it travels through the cylinder, hot gas atoms bombard the piston. This causes it to move in the only directly possible
	- We **extract high-ordered energy** (in ordered kinetic motion) **from disordered thermal energy**


##### Big Picture

This coherent kinetic energy can be used to move people (cars, planes, etc), build structures (bridges, cathedrals), and do a myriad of other constructive scenes

* The universe's inexorable slide into chaos can be **harnessed** for **construction of order**
	- As long as it is accompanied by **greater destruction of order elsewhere**
* However, it requires a complex machine
	- Early on, humans mastered burning fuels to create heat (wood, coal, oil --> fires, steam engines, etc)
		+ Trapped energy from the Sun, then uranium for fission, soon hydrogen for fusion
		+ Energy from the Big Bang
	- We only recently figured out how to burn fuels to **produce work**
		+ This sparked the industrial revolution


##### So What?

Thinking about it, a human is at least just such a complex machine.

* We take low entropy material containing high-quality energy: food-fuel
* We burn this food-fuel and expel waste high-entropy material / low-quality energy
* In the process, it constructs low-entropy energy
* Once we have the machine, we just need to feed it and it will function **spontaneously**
* What animates living organisms is simply the spontaneous, puposeless, dispersion of energy (& particles) from more ordered to less ordered forms
	- A human is a machine that harnesses...
