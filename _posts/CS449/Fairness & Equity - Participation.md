In the design stages of a study, researchers have to decide who to include and who to exclude in their recruitment of participants. They create a list of inclusion criteria and a list of exclusion criteria. These criteria are based upon the research question, the available participant population, and the goals of the research.

At the review stage, it is the REBâ€™s responsibility to examine the research proposal and determine if the inclusion and exclusion criteria are justified by the research question in accordance with the core principles of TCPS 2.

> Work station Comparison

Research Questions: Are there any measurable differences in user posture, alertness, fatigue, and subjective well-being between users assigned to the prototype, "WorkRite station" and users assigned to a standard work station?

Method: Participants will be randomly assigned to work at either a standard work station or a WorkRite station for a two hour period each day for two weeks. Participants will be assigned routine tasks and video-taped while they perform them to provide data for posture and alertness measures. After each session they will complete a well-being questionnaire.

What are the appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria for this study?

Inclusion Criteria:
- adults between the ages of 18 and 65 (age range of majority of adults in the workforce)
- currently employed in a job requiring the use of a standard workstation

Exclusion Criteria:
- anyone requiring adjustments to the workstation beyond its physical limitations
- anyone who has no experience using a standard workstation

> Learning Disability Assessment

Research Questions: Are assessments of learning disabilities (LD) currently in use in public schools correctly identifying children with LD? Is a new assessment method more accurate than the existing measure?

Method: Three participating schools will allow researchers to conduct LD assessments of primary school children on a one-to-one basis (with the consent of their parents). The results of these assessments will be compared with previous standard assessment reports.

What are the appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria for this study?

Inclusion Criteria:
- Children in grades one, two, or three attending a participating school whose parents have provided consent

Exclusion Criteria:
- Children whose parents have not provided consent
- Children who refuse to participate in the assessment
- Children with a severe learning disorder already sufficiently assessed

> Effects of Frequent Body Scans

Research Questions: What are the effects of frequent x-rays due to security procedures at airports and other international border checkpoints on the human body over time?

Method: Pilots and people identified as frequent business travellers will be asked for their consent to be assessed for the effects of radiation on cell tissue over one year. Samples of hair, skin, urine, and blood will be taken before and after each trip. After each trip participants will be asked to report whether or not they were exposed to an x-ray body scan.

What are the appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria for this study?

Inclusion Criteria:
- adults who routinely encounter x-ray body scan technology at airports or other International border checkpoints

Exclusion Criteria:
- anyone currently undergoing any kind of radiation treatment
- anyone who has undergone radiation treatment within the last five years
- anyone who has been exposed to high levels of radiation in the last five years
