# CS 449

Focus on target user groups.

* Look at different types of people in user group
* Need to create a participant pool
	- Should be same type
* ...

## Understanding Your Users: Exploratory Studies

### Questionnaires

* Open-ended and closed-ended questions
    - Multiple choice, matrix questions, scaled questions, semantic differential and likert scale questions are closed-ended
    - Unstructured, explanation, completion, and association questions are open-ended

### Observations

* Active/passive particpation, complete participation, non-participatory
* Naturalistic and controlled
* Record artifacts users manipulate
* Use codes and symbols
    - Things are happening too fast, use faster identification symbols that can be easily decoded
* Separate tasks, goals, motivations
* Separate actions and body language
* Separate **observations** and **interpretations**
    - The former doesn't necessarily lead to the latter
        + eg. Smiling doesn't always mean happy
* Participants your side notes separate
* Separate "says" and "does"

### Interviews

* In-depth discussion of the topic with a participant
* Usually one-on-one
* Written, audio, video recording options (_requires consent_)

##### Structured

Not much room to ideate and conceptualize. Interviews are very guided.

* Same set of questions
* Standardized process
* Little freedom of expression
* Often self-reported

##### Semi-structured

Other stories and questions that occur can be integrated

* Structure isn't as strict, and room for movement is available
* Has a list of guiding questions/topics
    - Leading questions influence the response in some way, usually by using implications
        + Should be avoided, because they don't provide unbiased results
* Often preceded by observation
* One of the most popular

##### Narrative (Unstructured)

General direction of where the interview wants to go

* Focus and objective guides the discussion
* Open-ended questions
* Freedom of expression & little control

##### Focus groups

Usually moderated, and directing conversation, but allows groups of people to develop conversations themselves.

* Semi-structured
* Moderated
* 6-10 homogeneous strangers
* May permit discussion
* Emerged in the 1940s

### Diary/Camera Studies

* Includes a mechanism (diary or camera) to record/describe relevant activities in everyday settings
    - For external validitiy, time and place matter
        + Thus, providing diverse environments, the additional data provides better, more applicable responses
* Longitudinal
    - "How do you feel at this moment?"
    - These questions spread across periods of time
* Data recorded by participants based on provided guidelines

**Diary study**

* A log of activities/behaviours you can use over a period of time
* Highlight things that stood out over the course of the day
* Photos provides better insight than simple words
    - Shows habits and behaviours over a time-frame that is often missed because we don't keep track of them explicitly
* Two weeks to two months
    - Depends on what is being investigated
    - Requires individuals that express information easily

### Participatory Design

* Participants are given design elements
    - Get individuals from your target audience to construct their ideal experience in real-time
        + Get answers quickly, and apply updates quickly
        + However, regarding reactivity, people kind of forget about generalization. They get caught up in the creative process that they forget about useability
* Helps to understand values and uncover mental models

### Ethnographic Field Studies

* Natural environment, everyday life
* First-hand participation in users' activities
* Description of the scene, key events, key actors, key artifacts, and actions
* Combination of observations and interviews
* Focus on objective behaviours

How can we improve the experience of the cruise head chef?

* First, analyze his tasks
    - Wakes up, checks emails and prepares
    - Meeting with his chef team
        + Interacting with chefs, and team
        + Instructions for the day
            * Cannot be done remotely
    - Invent(?)
    - Testing(?)
    - Interacting with potential customers

**Ethnographic Field Studies = Observations + Interviews + Natural context**

### Contextual Inquiry

* Natural environment, everyday life
* First-hand participation in participants' activities
* Relatively short (several hours)
* Research heavily involved in the process and constantly asks questions
* Mostly rely on self-report data

## Understanding Your Users: Analyzing Qualitative Data

Row-qualitative-data is "fuzzy data". It's not actionable yet

* Notes on cards --> Review the cards --> Sorting and grouping --> Smaller subgroups --> Themes in Data
    - This is our affinity datagram
        + Use all data
        + Use colour
            * eg. separate what people say from what they do
        + Regroup often
        + Use fresh view
        + Give it time
        + Trust

Self-balancing electric scooter (hover board)

* Observation 1
    - Unboxing
        + Manual first
            * **Doesn't look at it. Thinks he can get it done. Goes back to it later.**
        + Then charger cable
        + Then main item
    - Battery state(s)
        + "I think when it gets to yellow..." --> Mental model
    - Testing it out
        + Tried it out, didn't work well. "I have to read the manual"
        + Trying it with one foot first
            * **Fell, and kept trying but with another foot**
                - **Why does/should it matter?**
        + Lean forward --> move forward
        + Lean back --> backward
* Observation 2
    - Manual first, and actually looks through it
        + "Hope we don't have to charge for 24 hours"
        + Remote starter?
    - See charger, a lot smaller than expected
    - "Ordered black, but got green."
    - LED, potentially for battery indicators
    - Went back to look through manual before trying it out

## Quiz 1(?)

Talking about top ten key points of innovation, Guy Kawasaki gives an example with a car key

* ...

Who developed the concept of persona and what it is about (briefly)

* Creating a fictional character that embodies the characteristics of who you're studying

What Mobile-first design principle and what benefits does it provide?

* Progressive UI
* Design for mobile first, then expand to larger view-ports. Space-limitations and context allows better focus
    - Content-focused approach for UI
* Mobile is ubiquitousâ€”it is everywhere
    - Phones are much more personal and satisfying. It is your alter ego, fundamental to everything you do

## Understand Your Users: Exploratory Studies

### Exploratory Study

##### Motivational system

* Goals and tasks (need)
* Desirabiltiy (want)
* Emotional charge (fears, frustration, pleasure)

##### Contextual knowledge & beliefs

##### Cognitive (mental) model

* A cognitive representation of how something works/is organised
* Based on previous experience & beliefs
    - defines reasoning


`Enlightened trial and error succeeds over the trials of a lone genius`


### Translating Needs into Functionalities

#### Make data actionable

##### Adjust personas

- Make them more colourful and detailed, based on generalized characteristics of your participants that you didn't account for previously
    + There are likely several

##### Affinity diagrams

- A sense-making tool for qualitative data
    + Notes on cards --> Review --> Sorting --> Subgroups --> Themes

##### Breakdowns

- Where and when things go wrong in individuals work practice
- Points in time or space when individuals have a problem accomplishing the task that should otherwise be easy, given the tools they're using
- Unpacking the tacit dimension for possible design solutions

##### Cultural model (assignment 2)

- External influences
    + Important because work takes place in a culture, which defines expectations, desires, policies, vaues, and work approach itself
- Includes
    + Influences (bubbles)
    + Extent of influence (size of bubbles, overlap)
    + Influences (as arrows with direction)
    + Breakdowns

##### Artifact models

- Physical objects that support the work (created and/or used in the process)
    + Because you want to know what objects people need and interact with
    + Also applies to applications as well. These can be described using artifact models because they involve interaction
- Sketch or photo
- Complete with comments and notes regarding
    + Structure
    + Related purpose and tasks
    + Functionality

Creation of artifact models

* Based on our findings and cultural model, we have inspirations for creating our artifact models.

#### Identify right time and place

##### Physical model

* Because you want to known how people adapt their environment to accomplish work
    - Structures that limit and define space
    - Walls, desks, file cabinets, tables, chairs, etc
        + Things used in the process
    - Hardware, software, communication tools
    - Artifacts and their location in relation to each other
* Practically
    - How a chef on a cruise can observe his kitchens
    - How far a chef has to walk around
* Complete with comments and notes
* Not too detailed, just acknowledge that these things exist

Example

* Art library, workspaces, etc
* Printers are far away, so that's a breakdown, because the user is too far
* Door to oft-used room is on the opposite side of the wall --> breakdown
* Tall people block the lecture-hall screen for people behind --> breakdown

##### Sequence model

* Sequence of work steps and the intention behind steps
    - Because you want to know how work is organized in stages
* Includes
    - Intent behind step
    - Triggers that initiate sequence
    - Steps, at a high-level of details (actions, not movements)
    - Loops and branches showing order and iteratio
    - Breakdowns

Example (Hoverboard model)

1. Beginning: Open the box
    * Difficulties? Nah --> No breakdown
    * Trigger? Arrival of the package
|
|
V
2. Scan the inside of the box
|
|
V
3. Picked up manual
    * Expected to look through it, but usually didn't
    * Breakdown: Puts the manual away without reading
    * Trigger?

##### Flow model

* Directions of communication and coordination
* Defines how work is broken up across people and how people coordinate
* Includes
    - Interviewee (in the middle)
    - Other groups/people (circles)
    - Physical/virtual places (usually rectangles)
    - Artifacts as they pass between people
    - Breakdowns (where things go wrong)
